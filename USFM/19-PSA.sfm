\c 1
\q
\v 1 Blessed is the man who does not walk in the advice of the wicked,
\q1 or stand in the pathway with sinners,
\q1 or sit in the assembly of mockers.
\q
\v 2 But his delight is in the law of Yahweh,
\q1 and on his law he meditates day and night.
\q
\v 3 He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water
\q1 that produces its fruit in its season,
\q1 whose leaves do not wither;
\q1 whatever he does will prosper.
\q
\v 4 The wicked are not so,
\q1 but are instead like the chaff that the wind drives away.
\q
\v 5 So the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
\q1 nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
\q
\v 6 For Yahweh approves of the way of the righteous,
\q1 but the way of the wicked will perish.
\c 2
\m
\q
\v 1 Why are the nations in turmoil,
\q1 and why do the peoples make plots that will fail?
\q
\v 2 The kings of the earth take their stand together
\q1 and the rulers conspire together
\q1 against Yahweh and against his Messiah, saying,
\q
\v 3 "Let us tear off the shackles they put on us
\q1 and throw off their chains."
\q
\v 4 He who sits in the heavens will sneer at them;
\q1 the Lord mocks them.
\q
\v 5 Then he will speak to them in his anger
\q1 and terrify them in his rage, saying,
\q
\v 6 "I myself have anointed my king
\q1 on Zion, my holy mountain."
\q
\v 7 I will announce a decree of Yahweh.
\q1 He said to me, "You are my son!
\q1 This day I have become your father.
\q
\v 8 Ask me, and I will give you the nations for your inheritance
\q1 and the farthermost regions of the earth for your possession.
\q
\v 9 You will break them with an iron rod;
\q1 like a jar of a potter, you will smash them to pieces."
\q
\v 10 So now, you kings, be warned;
\q1 be corrected, you rulers of the earth.
\q
\v 11 Worship Yahweh in fear
\q1 and rejoice with trembling.
\q
\v 12 Kiss the son or he will be angry with you,
\q2 and you will die in the way when his anger burns for just a moment.
\q1 How blessed are all those who seek refuge in him.
\c 3
\m
\d A psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, how many are my enemies!
\q1 Many have risen against me.
\q
\v 2 Many say about me,
\q1 "There is no help for him from God." \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 3 But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me,
\q1 my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.
\q
\v 4 I lift up my voice to Yahweh,
\q1 and he answers me from his holy hill. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 I lay down and slept;
\q1 I awoke, for Yahweh protected me.
\q
\v 6 I will not be afraid of the multitudes of people
\q1 who have set themselves against me on every side.
\q
\v 7 Rise up, Yahweh! Save me, my God!
\q1 For you will hit all my enemies on the jaw;
\q1 you will break the teeth of the wicked.
\q
\v 8 Salvation comes from Yahweh.
\q1 May your blessings be on your people. \qs Selah\qs*
\c 4
\m
\d For the chief musician; on stringed instruments. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness;
\q1 give me room when I am hemmed in.
\q1 Have mercy on me and listen to my prayer.
\q
\v 2 You people, how long will you turn my honor into shame?
\q1 How long will you love that which is worthless and seek after lies? \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 3 But know that Yahweh sets apart the godly for himself.
\q1 Yahweh will hear when I call to him.
\q
\v 4 Tremble in fear, but do not sin!
\q1 Meditate in your heart on your bed and be silent. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness
\q1 and put your trust in Yahweh.
\q
\v 6 Many say, "Who will show us anything good?"
\q1 Yahweh, lift up the light of your face on us.
\q
\v 7 You have given my heart more gladness
\q1 than others have when their grain and new wine abound.
\q
\v 8 It is in peace that I will lie down and sleep,
\q1 for you alone, Yahweh, make me safe and secure.
\c 5
\m
\d For the chief musician; with wind instruments. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Listen to my call to you, Yahweh;
\q1 think about my groanings.
\q
\v 2 Listen to the sound of my call, my King and my God,
\q1 for it is to you that I pray.
\q
\v 3 Yahweh, in the morning you hear my cry;
\q1 in the morning I will bring my petition to you and wait expectantly.
\q
\v 4 Certainly you are not a God who approves of evil;
\q1 evil people will not be your guests.
\q
\v 5 The arrogant will not stand in your presence;
\q1 you hate all who behave wickedly.
\q
\v 6 You will destroy liars;
\q1 Yahweh despises violent and deceitful men.
\q
\v 7 But as for me, because of your great covenant faithfulness, I will come into your house;
\q1 in reverence I will bow down toward your holy temple.
\q
\v 8 Oh Lord, lead me in your righteousness because of my enemies;
\q1 make your path straight before me.
\q
\v 9 For there is no truth in their mouth;
\q1 their inward being is wicked;
\q1 their throat is an open tomb;
\q1 they flatter with their tongue.
\q
\v 10 Declare them guilty, God;
\q1 may their schemes be their downfall!
\q1 Drive them out for their many transgressions,
\q1 for they have rebelled against you.
\q
\v 11 But may all those who take refuge in you rejoice;
\q1 let them always shout for joy because you defend them;
\q1 let them be joyful in you, those who love your name.
\q
\v 12 For you will bless the righteous, Yahweh;
\q1 you will surround them with favor as with a shield.
\c 6
\m
\d For the chief musician; on stringed instruments, set to the Sheminith style. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, do not rebuke me in your anger
\q1 or discipline me in your wrath.
\q
\v 2 Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am frail;
\q1 heal me, Yahweh, for my bones are shaking.
\q
\v 3 My soul also is very troubled.
\q1 But you, Yahweh—how long will this continue?
\q
\v 4 Return, Yahweh! rescue me.
\q1 Save me because of your covenant faithfulness!
\q
\v 5 For in death there is no remembrance of you.
\q1 In Sheol who will give you thanks?
\q
\v 6 I am weary with my groaning.
\q1 All night I drench my bed with tears;
\q1 I wash my couch away with my tears.
\q
\v 7 My eyes grow dim from grief;
\q1 they grow weak because of all my adversaries.
\q
\v 8 Get away from me, all you who practice iniquity;
\q1 for Yahweh has heard the sound of my weeping.
\q
\v 9 Yahweh has heard my appeal for mercy;
\q1 Yahweh has accepted my prayer.
\q
\v 10 All my enemies will be ashamed and greatly troubled.
\q1 They will turn back and be suddenly humiliated.
\c 7
\m
\d A musical composition of David, which he sang to Yahweh concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite.
\q
\v 1 Yahweh my God, I take refuge in you!
\q1 Save me from all who chase me, and rescue me.
\q
\v 2 Otherwise, they will rip me apart like a lion,
\q1 tearing me in pieces with no one else able to bring me to safety.
\q
\v 3 Yahweh my God, if I have done this,
\q1 and there is guilt on my hands—
\q
\v 4 if I have done evil to him who was at peace with me,
\q1 or senselessly harmed my enemy without cause, then hear my words.
\q
\v 5 Then let my enemy pursue my life and overtake me;
\q1 let him trample my life to the ground
\q1 and lay my honor in the dust. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 6 Arise, Yahweh, in your anger;
\q1 stand up against the rage of my enemies;
\q1 wake up for my sake and carry out the righteous decrees that you have commanded for them.
\q
\v 7 The countries are assembled all around you;
\q1 take once more your rightful place over them.
\q
\v 8 Yahweh, judge the nations;
\q1 vindicate me, Yahweh, because I am righteous and innocent, Most High.
\q
\v 9 May the evil deeds of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous people,
\q1 righteous God, you who examine hearts and minds.
\q
\v 10 My shield comes from God,
\q1 the one who saves the upright in heart.
\q
\v 11 God is a righteous judge,
\q1 a God who is indignant each day.
\q
\v 12 If a person does not repent, God will sharpen his sword
\q1 and will prepare his bow for battle.
\q
\v 13 He prepares to use weapons against him;
\q1 he makes his arrows flaming shafts.
\q
\v 14 Think about the one who is pregnant with wickedness,
\q1 who conceives destructive plans, who gives birth to harmful lies.
\q
\v 15 He digs a pit and hollows it out
\q1 and then falls into the hole he has made.
\q
\v 16 His own destructive plans return to his own head,
\q1 for his violence comes down on his own head.
\q
\v 17 I will give thanks to Yahweh for his justice;
\q1 I will sing praise to Yahweh Most High.
\c 8
\m
\d For the chief musician; set to the gittith style. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Yahweh our Lord, how magnificent is your name in all the earth,
\q1 you who reveal your glory in the heavens above.
\q
\v 2 Out of the mouth of babies and infants you have established praise\f + \ft The Hebrew text can be read either as \fqa established praise \ft or \fqa established strength.\f*
\q1 because of your enemies,
\q1 so that you might silence both the enemy and the avenger.
\q
\v 3 When I look up at your heavens, which your fingers have made,
\q1 the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,
\q
\v 4 Of what importance is the human race that you notice them,
\q1 or mankind that you pay attention to them?
\q
\v 5 Yet you have made them only a little lower than the heavenly beings
\q1 and have crowned them with glory and honor.
\q
\v 6 You make him to rule over the works of your hands;
\q1 you have put all things under his feet:
\q
\v 7 all sheep and oxen,
\q1 and even the animals of the field,
\q
\v 8 the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea,
\q1 everything that passes through the currents of the seas.
\q
\v 9 Yahweh our Lord,
\q1 how magnificent is your name in all the earth!
\c 9
\m
\d For the chief musician; set to Muth Labben style. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart;
\q1 I will tell about all your marvelous deeds.
\q
\v 2 I will be glad and rejoice in you;
\q1 I will sing praise to your name, Most High!
\q
\v 3 When my enemies turn back,
\q1 they stumble and perish before you.
\q
\v 4 For you have defended my just cause;
\q1 you sit on your throne, a righteous judge!
\q
\v 5 You rebuked the nations;
\q1 you have destroyed the wicked;
\q1 you have blotted out their name forever and ever.
\q
\v 6 The enemy crumbled like ruins
\q1 when you overthrew their cities.
\q1 All remembrance of them has perished.
\q
\v 7 But Yahweh remains forever;
\q1 he has established his throne for justice.
\q
\v 8 He will judge the world with righteousness,
\q1 and he will execute judgment for the nations with fairness.
\q
\v 9 Yahweh also will be a stronghold for the oppressed,
\q1 a stronghold in times of trouble.
\q
\v 10 Those who know your name trust in you,
\q1 for you, Yahweh, do not abandon those who seek you.
\q
\v 11 Sing praises to Yahweh, who rules in Zion;
\q1 tell the nations what he has done.
\q
\v 12 For the God who avenges bloodshed remembers;
\q1 he does not forget the cry of the oppressed.
\q
\v 13 Have mercy on me, Yahweh; see how I am oppressed by those who hate me,
\q1 you who can snatch me from the gates of death.
\q
\v 14 Oh, that I might proclaim all your praise.
\q1 In the gates of the daughter of Zion
\q1 I will rejoice in your salvation!
\q
\v 15 The nations have sunk down into the pit that they made;
\q1 their feet are caught in the net that they hid.
\q
\v 16 Yahweh has made himself known; he has executed judgment;
\q1 the wicked is ensnared by his own actions. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 17 The wicked are turned back and sent to Sheol,
\q1 all the nations that forget God.
\q
\v 18 For the needy will not always be forgotten,
\q1 nor will the hope of the oppressed be forever dashed.
\q
\v 19 Arise, Yahweh; do not let man win against you;
\q1 may the nations be judged in your sight.
\q
\v 20 Terrify them, Yahweh;
\q1 may the nations know that they are mere men. \qs Selah\qs*
\c 10
\m
\q
\v 1 Why, Yahweh, do you stand far off?
\q1 Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
\q
\v 2 Because of their arrogance, wicked people chase the oppressed;
\q1 but please let the wicked be trapped by their own schemes that they have devised.
\q
\v 3 For the wicked person boasts of his deepest desires;
\q1 he blesses the greedy and insults Yahweh.
\q
\v 4 The wicked man has a raised face; he does not seek God.
\q1 He never thinks about God because he does not care at all about him.
\q
\v 5 He is secure at all times,
\q1 but your righteous decrees are too high for him;
\q1 he snorts at all his enemies.
\q
\v 6 He says in his heart," I will never fail;
\q1 throughout all generations I will not meet adversity."
\q
\v 7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceptive, harmful words;
\q1 his tongue injures and destroys.
\q
\v 8 He waits in ambush near the villages;
\q1 in the secret places he murders the innocent;
\q1 his eyes look for some helpless victim.
\q
\v 9 He lurks in secret like a lion in the thicket;
\q1 he lies in wait to catch the oppressed.
\q1 He catches the oppressed when he pulls in his net.
\q
\v 10 His victims are crushed and beaten down;
\q1 they fall into his strong nets.
\q
\v 11 He says in his heart, "God has forgotten;
\q1 he covers his face; he will not bother to look."
\q
\v 12 Arise, Yahweh! Lift up your hand, God!
\q1 Do not forget the oppressed.
\q
\v 13 Why does the wicked man reject God
\q1 and say in his heart, "You will not hold me accountable"?
\q
\v 14 You have taken notice, for you always see the one who inflicts the misery and sorrow.
\q1 The helpless entrusts himself to you;
\q1 you rescue the fatherless.
\q
\v 15 Break the arm of the wicked and evil man.
\q1 Make him account for his evil deeds,
\q1 which he thought you would not discover.
\q
\v 16 Yahweh is King forever and ever;
\q1 the nations are driven out of his land.
\q
\v 17 Yahweh, you have heard the needs of the oppressed;
\q1 you strengthen their heart, you listen to their prayer;
\q
\v 18 You defend the fatherless and the oppressed
\q1 so that no man on the earth will cause terror again.
\c 11
\m
\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 I take refuge in Yahweh;
\q1 how will you say to me,
\q1 "Flee like a bird to the mountain"?
\q
\v 2 For see! The wicked prepare their bows.
\q1 They make ready their arrows on the strings
\q1 to shoot in the darkness at the upright in heart.
\q
\v 3 For if the foundations are ruined,
\q1 what can the righteous do?
\q
\v 4 Yahweh is in his holy temple;
\q1 his eyes watch, his eyes examine the children of mankind.
\q
\v 5 Yahweh examines both the righteous and the wicked,
\q1 but he hates those who love to do violence.
\q
\v 6 He rains burning coals and brimstone upon the wicked;
\q1 a scorching wind will be their portion from his cup!
\q
\v 7 For Yahweh is righteous, and he loves righteousness;
\q1 the upright will see his face.
\c 12
\m
\d For the chief musician; set to the Sheminith. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Help, Yahweh, for the godly have disappeared;
\q1 the faithful have vanished.
\q
\v 2 Everyone says empty words to his neighbor;
\q1 everyone speaks with flattering lips and a double heart.
\q
\v 3 Yahweh, cut off all flattering lips,
\q1 every tongue declaring great things.
\q
\v 4 These are those who have said, "With our tongues will we prevail.
\q1 When our lips speak, who can be master over us?"
\q
\v 5 "Because of violence against the poor, because of the groans of the needy,
\q1 I will arise," says Yahweh.
\q1 "I will provide the safety for which they long."
\q
\v 6 The words of Yahweh are pure words,
\q1 like silver purified in a furnace on the earth,
\q1 refined seven times.
\q
\v 7 You are Yahweh! You keep them.
\q1 You preserve the godly people from this wicked generation and forever.
\q
\v 8 The wicked walk on every side
\q1 when evil is exalted among the children of mankind.
\c 13
\m
\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 How long, Yahweh, will you keep forgetting about me?
\q1 How long will you hide your face from me?
\q
\v 2 How long must I worry
\q1 and have grief in my heart all day?
\q1 How long will my enemy triumph over me?
\q
\v 3 Look at me and answer me, Yahweh my God!
\q1 Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep in death.
\q
\v 4 Do not let my enemy say, "I have defeated him,"
\q1 so that my enemy may not say, "I have prevailed over my adversary"; otherwise, my enemies will rejoice when I am brought down.
\q
\v 5 But I have trusted in your covenant faithfulness;
\q1 my heart rejoices in your salvation.
\q
\v 6 I will sing to Yahweh
\q1 because he has treated me very generously.
\c 14
\m
\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 A fool says in his heart, "There is no God."
\q1 They are corrupt and have done abominable iniquity;
\q1 there is no one who does good.
\q
\v 2 Yahweh looks down from heaven on the children of mankind
\q1 to see if there are any who understand,
\q1 who seek after him.
\q
\v 3 They have all turned away. Together they have become corrupt.
\q1 There is no one who does good, no, not one.
\q
\v 4 Do they not know anything, those who commit iniquity,
\q1 those who eat up my people as they eat bread,
\q1 but who do not call on Yahweh?
\q
\v 5 They tremble with dread,
\q1 for God is with the righteous assembly!
\q
\v 6 You want to humiliate the poor person
\q1 even though Yahweh is his refuge.
\q
\v 7 Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion!
\q1 When Yahweh brings back his people from the captivity,
\q1 then Jacob will rejoice and Israel will be glad!
\c 15
\m
\d A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, who may stay in your tabernacle?
\q1 Who may live on your holy hill?
\q
\v 2 Whoever walks blamelessly, does what is right
\q1 and speaks truth from his heart.
\q
\v 3 He does not slander with his tongue,
\q1 he does not harm others,
\q1 and he does not insult his neighbor.
\q
\v 4 The worthless person is despised in his eyes,
\q1 but he honors those who fear Yahweh.
\q1 He swears to his own disadvantage and does not take back his promises.
\q
\v 5 He does not charge interest when he lends money.
\q1 He does not take bribes to testify against the innocent.
\q1 He who does these things will never be shaken.
\c 16
\m
\d A michtam of David.
\q
\v 1 Protect me, God, for I take refuge in you.
\q
\v 2 I say to Yahweh, "You are my Lord; my goodness is nothing apart from you.
\q
\v 3 As for the holy people who are on the earth, they are noble people; all my delight is in them.
\q
\v 4 Their troubles will be increased, those who seek out other gods. I will not pour out drink offerings of blood to their gods
\q1 or lift up their names with my lips.
\q
\v 5 Yahweh, you are my chosen portion and my cup. You hold onto my lot.
\q
\v 6 Measuring lines have been laid for me in pleasant places; surely a pleasing inheritance is mine.
\q
\v 7 I will bless Yahweh, who counsels me; even at night my mind instructs me.
\q
\v 8 I set Yahweh before me at all times, so I will not be shaken from his right hand!
\q
\v 9 Therefore my heart is glad; my glory is rejoicing. Surely I will live in security.
\q
\v 10 For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol. You will not let your faithful one see the pit.
\q
\v 11 You teach me the path of life; abundant joy resides in your presence; delights abide in your right hand forever!"
\c 17
\m
\d A prayer of David.
\q
\v 1 Listen to my plea for justice, Yahweh; pay attention to my call for help!
\q1 Give ear to my prayer from lips without deceit.
\q
\v 2 Let my vindication come from your presence; let your eyes see what is right!
\q
\v 3 If you test my heart, if you come to me in the night,
\q1 you will purify me and will not find any evil plans; my mouth will not transgress.
\q
\v 4 As for the deeds of mankind, it is at the word of your lips that I have kept myself from the ways of the lawless.
\q
\v 5 My steps have held firmly to your tracks; my feet have not slipped.
\q
\v 6 I call to you, for you answer me, God; turn your ear to me and listen when I speak.
\q
\v 7 Show your covenant faithfulness in a wonderful way, you who save by your right hand those who take refuge in you from their enemies!
\q
\v 8 Protect me like the apple of your eye; hide me under the shadow of your wings
\q
\v 9 from the presence of the wicked ones who assault me, my enemies who surround me.
\q
\v 10 They have no mercy on anyone; their mouths speak with pride.
\q
\v 11 They have surrounded my steps. They set their eyes to strike me to the ground.
\q
\v 12 They are like a lion eager for a victim, like a young lion crouching in hidden places.
\q
\v 13 Arise, Yahweh! Attack them! Throw them down on their faces! Rescue my life from the wicked by your sword!
\q
\v 14 Rescue me from men by your hand, Yahweh, from men of this world whose prosperity is in this life alone!
\q1 You will fill the bellies of your treasured ones with riches; they will have many children and will leave their wealth to their children.
\q
\v 15 As for me, I will see your face in righteousness; I will be satisfied, when I awake, with a sight of you.
\c 18
\m
\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David, the servant of Yahweh, when he sang to Yahweh the words of this song on the day that Yahweh rescued him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He sang:
\q
\v 1 I love you, Yahweh, my strength.
\q
\v 2 Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, the one who brings me to safety; he is my God, my rock; I take refuge in him.
\q1 He is my shield, the horn of my salvation, and my stronghold.
\q
\v 3 I will call on Yahweh who is worthy to be praised, and I will be saved from my enemies.
\q
\v 4 The cords of death surrounded me, and the rushing waters of worthlessness overwhelmed me.
\q
\v 5 The cords of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death trapped me.
\q
\v 6 In my distress I called to Yahweh; I called for help to my God. He heard my voice from his temple;
\q1 my call for help went into his presence; it went into his ears.
\q
\v 7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of the mountains also trembled
\q1 and were shaken because God was angry.
\q
\v 8 Smoke went up from out of his nostrils, and blazing fire came out of his mouth. Coals were ignited by it.
\q
\v 9 He opened the heavens and came down, and thick darkness was under his feet.
\q
\v 10 He rode on a cherub and flew; he glided on the wings of the wind.
\q
\v 11 He made darkness a tent around him, heavy rainclouds in the skies.
\q
\v 12 Hailstones and coals of fire fell from the lightning before him.
\q
\v 13 Yahweh thundered in the heavens! The voice of the Most High shouted.\f + \ft Some modern versions add after shouted, \fqa hailstones and coals of fire \ft this expression may be an accidental repetition from the previous verse.\f*
\q
\v 14 He shot his arrows and scattered his enemies; many lightning bolts dispersed them.
\q
\v 15 Then the water channels appeared;
\q1 the foundations of the world were laid bare
\q1 at your rebuke, Yahweh,
\q1 at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
\q
\v 16 He reached down from above; he took hold of me! He pulled me out of the surging water.
\q
\v 17 He rescued me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me, for they were too strong for me.
\q
\v 18 They came against me on the day of my distress but Yahweh was my support!
\q
\v 19 He set me free in a wide open place; he saved me because he was pleased with me.
\q
\v 20 Yahweh has rewarded me because of my righteousness; he has restored me because my hands were clean.
\q
\v 21 For I have kept the ways of Yahweh and have not wickedly turned away from my God.
\q
\v 22 For all his righteous decrees have been before me; as for his statutes, I have not turned away from them.
\q
\v 23 I have also been innocent before him, and I have kept myself from sin.
\q
\v 24 Therefore Yahweh has restored me because of my righteousness, because my hands were clean before his eyes.
\q
\v 25 To anyone who is faithful, you show yourself to be faithful;
\q2 to a man who is blameless, you show yourself to be blameless.
\q
\v 26 To anyone who is pure, you show yourself pure; but you are clever toward anyone who is twisted.
\q
\v 27 For you save afflicted people, but you bring down those with proud, uplifted eyes!

\v 28 For you give light to my lamp; Yahweh my God lights up my darkness.
\q
\v 29 For by you I can run over a barricade; by my God I can leap over a wall.
\q
\v 30 As for God—his way is perfect! The word of Yahweh is pure!
\q1 He is a shield to everyone who takes refuge in him.
\q
\v 31 For who is God except Yahweh? Who is a rock except our God?
\q
\v 32 It is God who puts strength on me like a belt, who places the blameless person on his path.
\q
\v 33 He makes my feet swift like a deer and places me on the heights!
\q
\v 34 He trains my hands for war and my arms to bend a bow of bronze.
\q
\v 35 You have given me the shield of your salvation. Your right hand has supported me, and your favor has made me great.
\q
\v 36 You have made a wide place for my feet beneath me so that my feet have not slipped.
\q
\v 37 I pursued my enemies and caught them; I did not turn back until they were destroyed.
\q
\v 38 I smashed them so that they were unable to rise; they have fallen under my feet.
\q
\v 39 For you put strength on me like a belt for battle; you put under me those who rise up against me.
\q
\v 40 You gave me the back of my enemies' necks; I annihilated those who hated me.
\q
\v 41 They called for help, but no one saved them; they called out to Yahweh, but he did not answer them.
\q
\v 42 I beat them into fine pieces like dust before the wind; I threw them out like mud in the streets.
\q
\v 43 You rescued me from the disputes of people. You have made me the head over nations. People that I have not known serve me.
\q
\v 44 As soon as they heard of me, they obeyed me; foreigners were forced to bow to me.
\q
\v 45 The foreigners came trembling out of their strongholds.
\q
\v 46 Yahweh lives; may my rock be praised. May the God of my salvation be exalted.
\q
\v 47 He is the God who executes vengeance for me, who subdues the nations under me.
\q
\v 48 I am set free from my enemies! Indeed, you lifted me above the ones who rose against me! You rescued me from violent men.
\q
\v 49 Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations; I will sing praises to your name!

\v 8 The instructions of Yahweh are right, making the heart glad;

\q
\v 9 The fear of Yahweh is pure, enduring forever;
\q1 the righteous decrees of Yahweh are true and altogether right!

\v 2 Blessed is the man to whom Yahweh reckons no guilt
\q1 and in whose spirit there is no deceit.
\q
\v 3 When I remained silent, my bones were wasting away
\q1 while I groaned all day long.
\q
\v 4 For day and night your hand was heavy upon me.
\q1 My strength withered as in summer drought. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 Then I acknowledged my sin to you,
\q1 and I no longer hid my iniquity.
\q1 I said, "I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh,"
\q1 and you forgave the guilt of my sin. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 6 Because of this, all who are godly should pray to you at a time of great distress.
\q1 Then when the surging waters overflow, they will not reach those people.
\q
\v 7 You are my hiding place; you will guard me from trouble.
\q1 You will surround me with the songs of victory. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go.
\q1 I will instruct you with my eye upon you.
\q
\v 9 Do not be like a horse or like a mule, which have no understanding;
\q1 it is only with bridle and bit to control them
\q1 that they will go where you want them to.
\q
\v 10 The wicked have many sorrows,
\q1 but Yahweh's covenant faithfulness will surround the one who trusts in him.
\q
\v 11 Be glad in Yahweh, and rejoice, you righteous;
\q1 shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart.
\c 33
\m
\q
\v 1 Rejoice in Yahweh, you righteous;
\q1 praise is appropriate for the upright.
\q
\v 2 Give thanks to Yahweh with the harp;
\q1 sing praises to him with the harp of ten strings.
\q
\v 3 Sing to him a new song;
\q1 play skillfully and sing with joy.
\q
\v 4 For Yahweh's word is upright,
\q1 and everything he does is fair.
\q
\v 5 He loves righteousness and justice.
\q1 The earth is full of Yahweh's covenant faithfulness.
\q
\v 6 By the word of Yahweh the heavens were made,
\q1 and all the stars were made by the breath of his mouth.
\q
\v 7 He gathers the waters of the sea together like a heap;
\q1 he puts the oceans in storehouses.
\q
\v 8 Let the whole earth fear Yahweh;
\q1 let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
\q
\v 9 For he spoke, and it was done;
\q1 he commanded, and it stood in place.
\q
\v 10 Yahweh frustrates the alliances of nations;
\q1 he overrules the plans of the peoples.
\q
\v 11 The plans of Yahweh stand forever,
\q1 the plans of his heart for all generations.
\q
\v 12 Blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh,
\q1 the people whom he has chosen as his own inheritance.
\q
\v 13 Yahweh looks from heaven;
\q1 he sees all the people.
\q
\v 14 From the place where he lives,
\q1 he looks down on all who live on the earth.
\q
\v 15 He who shapes the hearts of them all
\q1 observes all their deeds.
\q
\v 16 No king is saved by a vast army;
\q1 a warrior is not saved by his great strength.
\q
\v 17 A horse is a false hope for victory;
\q1 in spite of his great strength, he cannot rescue.
\q
\v 18 See, Yahweh's eye is on those who fear him,
\q1 on those who hope in his covenant faithfulness
\q
\v 19 to deliver their lives from death
\q1 and to keep them alive in times of famine.
\q
\v 20 We wait for Yahweh;
\q1 he is our help and our shield.
\q
\v 21 Our hearts rejoice in him,
\q1 for we trust in his holy name.
\q
\v 22 Let your covenant faithfulness, Yahweh, be with us
\q1 as we put our hope in you.

\m
\d A psalm of David; when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech, who drove him out.
\q
\v 1 I will praise Yahweh at all times,
\q1 his praise will always be in my mouth.
\q
\v 2 I will praise Yahweh!
\q1 May the oppressed hear and rejoice.
\q
\v 3 Praise Yahweh with me,
\q1 let us lift up his name together.
\q
\v 4 I sought Yahweh and he answered me,
\q1 and he gave me victory over all my fears.
\q
\v 5 Those who look to him are radiant,
\q1 and their faces are not ashamed.
\q
\v 6 This oppressed man cried and Yahweh heard him
\q1 and saved him from all his troubles.
\q
\v 7 The angel of Yahweh camps around those who fear him
\q1 and rescues them.
\q
\v 8 Taste and see that Yahweh is good.
\q1 Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.
\q
\v 9 Fear Yahweh, you his holy people.
\q1 There is no lack for those who fear him.
\q
\v 10 The young lions sometimes lack food and suffer hunger,
\q1 but those who seek Yahweh will not lack anything good.
\q
\v 11 Come, sons, listen to me.
\q1 I will teach you the fear of Yahweh.
\q
\v 12 What man is there who desires life
\q1 and loves many days,
\q1 that he may see good?
\q
\v 13 Then keep your tongue from evil
\q1 and keep your lips from speaking lies.
\q
\v 14 Turn away from evil and do good.
\q1 Seek peace and go after it.
\q
\v 15 The eyes of Yahweh are on the righteous
\q1 and his ears are directed toward their cry.
\q
\v 16 The face of Yahweh is against those who do evil,
\q1 to cut off the memory of them from the earth.
\q
\v 17 The righteous cry out and Yahweh hears
\q1 and he rescues them from all their troubles.
\q
\v 18 Yahweh is close to the brokenhearted,
\q1 and he saves those who are crushed in spirit.
\q
\v 19 Many are the troubles of the righteous,
\q1 but Yahweh delivers them out of them all.
\q
\v 20 He keeps all his bones,
\q1 not one of them will be broken.
\q
\v 21 Evil will kill the wicked.
\q1 Those who hate the righteous will be condemned.
\q
\v 22 Yahweh rescues the lives of his servants.
\q1 None of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.
\c 35
\m
\d A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, work against those who work against me;
\q1 fight against those who fight against me.
\q
\v 2 Grab your small shield and large shield;
\q1 rise up and help me.
\q
\v 3 Use your spear and battle ax against those who chase me;
\q1 say to my soul, "I am your salvation."
\q
\v 4 May those who seek my life be shamed and dishonored.
\q1 May those who plan to harm me be turned back and confounded.
\q
\v 5 May they be as chaff before the wind,
\q1 as the angel of Yahweh drives them away.
\q
\v 6 May their way be dark and slippery,
\q1 as the angel of Yahweh chases them.
\q
\v 7 Without cause they set their net for me;
\q1 without cause they dug a pit for my life.
\q
\v 8 Let destruction overtake them by surprise.
\q1 Let the net that they have set catch them.
\q1 Let them fall into it, to their destruction.
\q
\v 9 But I will be joyful in Yahweh
\q1 and rejoice in his salvation.
\q
\v 10 All my bones will say, "Yahweh, who is like you,
\q1 who rescues the oppressed from those who are too strong for them
\q1 and the poor and needy from those who try to rob them?"
\q
\v 11 Unrighteous witnesses rise up;
\q1 they accuse me falsely.
\q
\v 12 They repay me evil for good.
\q1 I am sorrowful.
\q
\v 13 But, when they were sick, I wore sackcloth;
\q1 I fasted for them
\q1 with my head bowed on my chest.
\q
\v 14 I went about in grief as for my brother;
\q1 I bent down in mourning as for my mother.
\q
\v 15 But when I stumbled, they rejoiced and gathered together;
\q1 they gathered together against me, and I was surprised by them.
\q1 They tore at me without stopping.
\q
\v 16 With no respect at all they mocked me;
\q1 they grind their teeth at me in rage.
\q
\v 17 Lord, how long will you look on?
\q1 Rescue my soul from their destructive attacks,
\q1 my life from the lions.
\q
\v 18 Then I will thank you in the great assembly;
\q1 I will praise you among many people.
\q
\v 19 Do not let my deceitful enemies rejoice over me;
\q1 do not let them carry out their wicked schemes.
\q
\v 20 For they do not speak peace,
\q1 but they devise deceitful words against those in our land who live in peace.
\q
\v 21 They open their mouths wide against me;
\q1 they said, "Aha, Aha, our eyes have seen it."
\q
\v 22 You have seen it, Yahweh, do not be silent;
\q1 Lord, do not be far from me.
\q
\v 23 Arouse yourself and awake to my defense;
\q1 My God and my Lord, defend my cause.
\q
\v 24 Defend me, Yahweh my God, because of your righteousness;
\q1 do not let them rejoice over me.
\q
\v 25 Do not let them say in their heart, "Aha, we have what we wanted."
\q1 Do not let them say, "We have devoured him."
\q
\v 26 May they be put to shame and may they be confounded who rejoice at my distress.
\q1 May those who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and dishonor.
\q
\v 27 Let those who desire my vindication shout for joy and be glad;
\q1 may they say continually, "Yahweh be praised,
\q1 he who delights in the welfare of his servant."
\q
\v 28 Then I will tell of your justice
\q1 and praise you all day long.

\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David the servant of Yahweh.
\q
\v 1 An evil man speaks of his transgression from deep in his heart,
\q1 there is no fear of God in his eyes.
\q
\v 2 For he comforts himself,
\q1 thinking that his sin will not be discovered and be hated.
\q
\v 3 His words are sinful and deceitful;
\q1 he does not want to be wise and do good.
\q
\v 4 While he lies in bed, he plans ways to sin;
\q1 he sets out on an evil way;
\q1 he does not reject evil.
\q
\v 5 Your covenant faithfulness, Yahweh, reaches to the heavens;
\q1 your loyalty reaches to the clouds.
\q
\v 6 Your righteousness is like the mountains of God;
\q1 your judgments are like the great deep.
\q1 Yahweh, you preserve both mankind and the animals.
\q
\v 7 How precious is your covenant faithfulness, God!
\q1 Humanity takes refuge under the shadow of your wings.
\q
\v 8 They feast upon the abundance of your house;
\q1 you let them drink from the river of your delights.
\q
\v 9 For with you is the fountain of life;
\q1 in your light we will see light.
\q
\v 10 Extend your covenant faithfulness fully to those who know you,
\q1 your defense to the upright of heart.
\q
\v 11 Do not let the foot of the arrogant man come near to me.
\q1 Do not let the hand of the wicked drive me away.
\q
\v 12 Over there the evildoers have fallen;
\q1 they are knocked down and are not able to get up.
\c 37
\m
\d A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Do not be irritated because of evildoers;
\q1 do not be envious of those who act unrighteously.
\q
\v 2 For they will soon dry up as the grass
\q1 and wither as the green plants.
\q
\v 3 Trust in Yahweh and do what is good;
\q1 settle in the land and graze in faithfulness.
\q
\v 4 Then delight yourself in Yahweh,
\q1 and he will give you the desires of your heart.
\q
\v 5 Give your ways to Yahweh;
\q1 trust in him, and he will act on your behalf.
\q
\v 6 He will display your justice like the daylight
\q1 and your innocence like the day at noon.
\q
\v 7 Be still before Yahweh and wait patiently for him.
\q1 Do not be angry if someone succeeds in what he does,
\q1 or when he makes evil plots.
\q
\v 8 Do not be angry and frustrated.
\q1 Do not worry. This only makes trouble.
\q
\v 9 Evildoers will be cut off,
\q1 but those who wait for Yahweh will inherit the land.
\q
\v 10 In a little while the evil man will disappear;
\q1 you will look at his place, but he will be gone.
\q
\v 11 But the meek will inherit the land
\q1 and will delight in great prosperity.
\q
\v 12 The wicked man plots against the righteous
\q1 and he grinds his teeth in rage against him.
\q
\v 13 The Lord laughs at him,
\q1 for he sees that his day is coming.
\q
\v 14 The wicked have drawn out their swords and have bent their bows
\q1 to cast down the oppressed and needy,
\q1 to kill those who are upright.
\q
\v 15 Their swords will pierce their own hearts,
\q1 and their bows will be broken.
\q
\v 16 Better is the little that the righteous has
\q1 than the abundance of many wicked people.
\q
\v 17 For the arms of the wicked people will be broken,
\q1 but Yahweh supports the righteous people.
\q
\v 18 Yahweh watches over the blameless day by day,
\q1 and their heritage will be forever.
\q
\v 19 They will not be ashamed when times are bad.
\q1 When famine comes, they will have enough to eat.
\q
\v 20 But evil men will perish.
\q1 Yahweh's enemies will be like the glory of the pastures;
\q1 they will be consumed and disappear in the smoke.
\q
\v 21 The wicked person borrows but does not repay,
\q1 but the righteous person is generous and gives.
\q
\v 22 Those who are blessed by God will inherit the land;
\q1 those who are cursed by him will be cut off.
\q
\v 23 It is by Yahweh that a man's steps are established,
\q1 the man whose way is commendable in God's sight.
\q
\v 24 Though he stumbles, he will not fall down,
\q1 for Yahweh is holding him with his hand.
\q
\v 25 I was young and now am old;
\q1 I have never seen the righteous person abandoned
\q1 or his children begging for bread.
\q
\v 26 All the day long he is gracious and lends,
\q1 and his children become a blessing.
\q
\v 27 Turn away from evil and do what is right;
\q1 then you will be safe forever.
\q
\v 28 For Yahweh loves justice
\q1 and does not abandon his faithful followers.
\q1 They are preserved forever,
\q1 but the descendants of the wicked will be cut off.
\q
\v 29 The righteous will inherit the land
\q1 and live there forever.
\q
\v 30 The mouth of the righteous person speaks wisdom
\q1 and increases justice.
\q
\v 31 The law of his God is in his heart;
\q1 his feet will not slip.
\q
\v 32 The wicked person watches the righteous person
\q1 and seeks to kill him.
\q
\v 33 Yahweh will not abandon him into the evil person's hand
\q1 or condemn him when he is judged.
\q
\v 34 Wait for Yahweh and keep his way,
\q1 and he will raise you up to possess the land.
\q1 You will see when the wicked are cut off.
\q
\v 35 I have seen the wicked and terrifying person
\q1 spread out like a green tree in its native soil.
\q
\v 36 But when I passed by again, he was not there.
\q1 I looked for him, but he could not be found.
\q
\v 37 Observe the man of integrity, and mark the upright;
\q1 there is a good future for a man of peace.
\q
\v 38 Sinners will be totally destroyed;
\q1 the future for the wicked man is cut off.
\q
\v 39 Salvation of the righteous comes from Yahweh;
\q1 he protects them in the times of trouble.
\q
\v 40 Yahweh helps them and rescues them.
\q1 He rescues them from evil men and saves them
\q1 because they have taken refuge in him.

\d A psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, do not rebuke me in your anger;
\q1 do not punish me in your wrath.
\q
\v 2 For your arrows pierce me,
\q1 and your hand presses me down.
\q
\v 3 My whole body is sick because of your anger;
\q1 there is no health in my bones because of my sin.
\q
\v 4 For my iniquities overwhelm me;
\q1 they are a burden too heavy for me.
\q
\v 5 My wounds are infected and smell
\q1 because of my foolish sins.
\q
\v 6 I am stooped over and humiliated every day;
\q1 I go about mourning all day long.
\q
\v 7 For within me, I am filled with burning;
\q1 there is no health in my flesh.
\q
\v 8 I am numb and utterly crushed;
\q1 I groan because of the anguish of my heart.
\q
\v 9 Lord, you understand my heart's deepest yearnings,
\q1 and my groanings are not hidden from you.
\q
\v 10 My heart pounds, my strength fades,
\q1 and my eyesight dims.
\q
\v 11 My friends and companions shun me because of my condition;
\q1 my neighbors stand far off.
\q
\v 12 Those who seek my life lay snares for me.
\q1 They who seek my harm speak destructive words
\q1 and say deceitful words all day long.
\q
\v 13 But I, I am like a deaf man and hear nothing;
\q1 I am like a mute man who says nothing.
\q
\v 14 I am like a man who does not hear
\q1 and who has no reply.
\q
\v 15 Surely I wait for you, Yahweh;
\q1 you will answer, Lord my God.
\q
\v 16 I say this so that my enemies will not gloat over me.
\q1 If my foot slips, they will do terrible things to me.
\q
\v 17 For I am about to stumble,
\q1 and I am in constant pain.
\q
\v 18 I confess my guilt;
\q1 I am concerned about my sin.
\q
\v 19 But my enemies are numerous;
\q1 those who hate me wrongfully are many.
\q
\v 20 They repay me evil for good;
\q1 they hurl accusations at me although I have pursued what is good.
\q
\v 21 Do not abandon me, Yahweh;

\q
\v 1 I decided, "I will watch what I say
\q1 so that I do not sin with my tongue.
\q1 I will muzzle my mouth
\q1 while in the presence of an evil man."
\q
\v 2 I kept silent; I kept back my words even from saying anything good,
\q1 and my pain grew worse.
\q
\v 3 My heart became hot;
\q1 when I thought about these things, it burned like a fire.
\q1 Then finally I spoke.
\q
\v 4 "Yahweh, make me know when will be the end of my life
\q1 and the extent of my days.
\q1 Show me how transient I am.
\q
\v 5 See, you have made my days only the width of my hand,
\q1 and my lifetime is like nothing before you.
\q1 Surely every man is a single breath. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 6 Surely every man walks about like a shadow.
\q1 Surely everyone hurries about
\q1 to accumulate riches although they do not know who will receive them.
\q
\v 7 Now, Lord, for what am I waiting?
\q1 You are my only hope.
\q
\v 8 Rescue me from my sins;
\q1 do not make me the reproach of fools.
\q
\v 9 I am silent and cannot open my mouth,
\q1 because it is you who has done it.
\q
\v 10 Stop wounding me;
\q1 I am overwhelmed by the blow of your hand.
\q
\v 11 When you discipline people for sin,
\q1 you consume the things they desire like a moth;
\q1 surely all people are nothing but vapor. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 12 Hear my prayer, Yahweh, and listen to me;
\q1 listen to my weeping!
\q1 Do not be deaf to me,

\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 I waited patiently for Yahweh;
\q1 he listened to me and heard my cry.
\q
\v 2 He brought me up out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay,
\q1 and he set my feet on a rock and made my steps secure.
\q
\v 3 He has put a new song in my mouth, praise to our God.
\q1 Many will see it and honor him
\q1 and will trust in Yahweh.
\q
\v 4 Blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust
\q1 and does not honor the proud or those who turn away from him to lies.
\q
\v 5 Many, Yahweh my God, are the wonderful deeds that you have done,
\q1 and your thoughts which are about us cannot be numbered;
\q1 if I declared and spoke of them,
\q1 they would be more than could be counted.
\q
\v 6 You have no delight in sacrifice or offering,
\q1 but you have opened my ears;
\q1 you have not required burnt offerings or sin offerings.
\q
\v 7 Then said I, "See, I have come;
\q1 it is written about me in the scroll of the document.
\q
\v 8 I delight to do your will, my God;
\q1 your laws are in my heart."
\q
\v 9 I have proclaimed good news of your righteousness in the great assembly;
\q1 Yahweh, you know that my lips have not kept back from doing this.
\q
\v 10 I have not concealed your righteousness in my heart;
\q1 I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation;
\q1 I have not concealed your covenant faithfulness or your trustworthiness from the great assembly.
\q
\v 11 Do not keep back your acts of mercy from me, Yahweh;
\q1 let your covenant faithfulness and your trustworthiness always preserve me.
\q
\v 12 Troubles that cannot be numbered surround me;
\q1 my iniquities have caught up with me so that I am no longer able to see anything;
\q1 they are more than the hairs on my head,
\q1 and my heart has failed me.
\q
\v 13 Be pleased, Yahweh, to rescue me;
\q1 hurry to help me, Yahweh.
\q
\v 14 Let them be ashamed and completely disappointed
\q1 who pursue my life to take it away.
\q1 Let them be turned back and brought to dishonor,

\q
\v 15 Let them be shocked because of their shame,

\q
\v 16 But may all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you;
\q1 let everyone who loves your salvation say continually,
\q1 "May Yahweh be praised."

\v 1 Blessed is he who is concerned for the weak;

\v 2 Yahweh will preserve him and keep him alive,
\q1 and he will be blessed on the earth;
\q1 Yahweh will not turn him over to the will of his enemies.
\q
\v 3 Yahweh will support him on the bed of suffering;
\q1 you will make his bed of sickness into a bed of healing.
\q
\v 4 I said, "Yahweh, have mercy on me!
\q1 Heal me, for I have sinned against you."
\q
\v 5 My enemies speak evil against me, saying,
\q1 'When will he die and his name perish?'
\q
\v 6 If my enemy comes to see me, he says worthless things;
\q1 his heart gathers up my disaster for itself;
\q1 when he goes away from me, he tells others about it.
\q
\v 7 All who hate me whisper together against me;
\q1 against me they hope for my hurt.
\q
\v 8 They say, "An evil disease holds on tightly to him;
\q1 now that he is lying down, he will rise up no more."
\q
\v 9 Indeed, even my own close friend, in whom I trusted,
\q1 who ate my bread,
\q1 has lifted up his heel against me.

\q
\v 4 These things I call to mind as I pour out my soul:

\q1 with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude celebrating a festival.
\q
\v 5 Why are you bowed down, my soul?
\q1 Why are you upset within me?
\q1 Hope in God, for again I will praise him who is my salvation.
\q
\v 6 My God, my soul is bowed down within me,
\q1 therefore I call you to mind from the land of the Jordan,
\q1 from the three peaks of Mount Hermon, and from the hill of Mizar.
\q
\v 7 Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls;

\q1 Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"

\v 3 Oh, send out your light and your truth, let them lead me.
\q1 Let them bring me to your holy hill

\d For the chief musician. A psalm of the sons of Korah. A maschil.
\q
\v 1 We have heard with our ears, God,
\q1 our fathers have told us
\q1 what work you did in their days,
\q1 in the days of old.
\q
\v 2 You drove out the nations with your hand,
\q1 but you planted our people;
\q1 you afflicted the peoples,
\q1 but you spread our people out in the land.
\q
\v 3 For they did not obtain the land for their possession by their own sword,
\q1 neither did their own arm save them;
\q1 but your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face,
\q1 because you were favorable to them.
\q
\v 4 God, You are my King;
\q1 command victory for Jacob.
\q
\v 5 Through you we will push down our adversaries;
\q1 through your name we will tread them under, those who rise up against us.
\q
\v 6 For I will not trust in my bow,
\q1 neither will my sword save me.
\q
\v 7 But you have saved us from our adversaries,
\q1 and have put to shame those who hate us.
\q
\v 8 In God we have made our boast all the day long,
\q1 and we will give thanks to your name forever. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 9 But now you have thrown us off and brought us dishonor,
\q1 and you do not go out with our armies.
\q
\v 10 You make us turn back from the adversary;
\q1 and those who hate us take spoil for themselves.
\q
\v 11 You have made us like sheep to be slaughtered
\q1 and have scattered us among the nations.
\q
\v 12 You sell your people for nothing;
\q1 you have not increased your wealth by doing so.
\q
\v 13 You make us a rebuke to our neighbors,
\q1 scoffed and mocked by those around us.
\q
\v 14 You make us an insult among the nations,
\q1 a shaking of the head among the peoples.
\q
\v 15 All the day long my dishonor is before me,
\q1 and the shame of my face has covered me
\q
\v 16 because of the voice of him who rebukes and insults,
\q1 because of the enemy and the avenger.
\q
\v 17 All this has come on us; yet we have not forgotten you
\q1 or dealt falsely with your covenant.
\q
\v 18 Our heart has not turned back;
\q1 our steps have not gone from your way.
\q
\v 19 Yet you have severely broken us in the place of jackals
\q1 and covered us with the shadow of death.
\q
\v 20 If we have forgotten the name of our God
\q1 or spread out our hands to a strange god,
\q
\v 21 would not God search this out?
\q1 For he knows the secrets of the heart.
\q
\v 22 Indeed, for your sake we are being killed all day long;
\q1 we are considered to be sheep for the slaughter.
\q
\v 23 Awake, why do you sleep, Lord?
\q1 Arise, do not throw us off permanently.
\q
\v 24 Why do you hide your face
\q1 and forget our affliction and our oppression?
\q
\v 25 For we have melted away into the dust;
\q1 our bodies cling to the earth.
\q
\v 26 Rise up for our help
\q1 and redeem us for the sake of your covenant faithfulness.

\q
\v 1 My heart overflows on a good subject;
\q1 I will read aloud the words I have composed about the king;
\q1 my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
\q
\v 2 You are fairer than the children of mankind;
\q1 grace is poured onto your lips;
\q1 therefore we know that God has blessed you forever.
\q
\v 3 Put your sword on your side, mighty one,
\q1 in your glory and your majesty.
\q
\v 4 In your majesty ride on triumphantly
\q1 because of trustworthiness, meekness, and righteousness;
\q1 your right hand will teach you fearful things.
\q
\v 5 Your arrows are sharp;
\q1 the peoples fall under you;
\q1 your arrows are in the hearts of the king's enemies.
\q
\v 6 Your throne, God, is forever and ever;
\q1 a scepter of justice is the scepter of your kingdom.
\q
\v 7 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;
\q1 therefore God, your God, has anointed you
\q1 with the oil of gladness more than your companions.
\q
\v 8 All your garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia;
\q1 out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad.
\q
\v 9 Kings' daughters are among your honorable women;
\q1 at your right hand stands the queen clothed in gold of Ophir.
\q
\v 10 Listen, daughter, consider and incline your ear;
\q1 forget your own people and your father's house.
\q
\v 11 In this way the king will desire your beauty;
\q1 he is your master; revere him.
\q
\v 12 The daughter of Tyre will be there with a gift;
\q1 the rich among the people will beg for your favor.
\q
\v 13 The royal daughter in the palace is all glorious;
\q1 her clothing is worked with gold.
\q
\v 14 She will be led to the king in embroidered dress;
\q1 the virgins, her companions who follow her,
\q1 will be brought to you.
\q
\v 15 They will be led by gladness and rejoicing;
\q1 they will enter into the king's palace.
\q
\v 16 In the place of your fathers will be your children,
\q1 whom you will make princes in all the earth.
\q
\v 17 I will make your name to be remembered in all generations;
\q1 therefore the peoples will give you thanks forever and ever.

\q
\v 1 God is our refuge and strength,
\q1 a very present help in trouble.
\q
\v 2 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth should change,
\q1 though the mountains should be shaken into the heart of the seas,
\q
\v 3 though its waters roar and rage, and
\q1 though the mountains tremble with their swelling. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 There is a river whose streams make the city of God happy,
\q1 the holy place where the Most High dwells.
\q
\v 5 God is in the middle of her; she will not be moved;
\q1 God will help her, and he will do so at the dawn of morning.
\q
\v 6 The nations raged and the kingdoms were shaken;
\q1 he lifted up his voice, and the earth melted.
\q
\v 7 Yahweh of hosts is with us;
\q1 the God of Jacob is our refuge. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 8 Come, behold the deeds of Yahweh,
\q1 the destruction he has caused on earth.
\q
\v 9 He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth;
\q1 he breaks the bow and cuts the spear into pieces;
\q1 he burns up the shields.
\q
\v 10 Be quiet and know that I am God;
\q1 I will be exalted among the nations; I will be exalted on the earth.

\v 1 Clap your hands, all you peoples;

\q
\v 2 For Yahweh Most High is terrifying;
\q1 he is a great King over all the earth.
\q
\v 3 He subdues peoples under us
\q1 and nations under our feet.
\q
\v 4 He chooses our inheritance for us,
\q1 the glory of Jacob whom he loved. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 God has gone up with a shout,
\q1 Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet.
\q
\v 6 Sing praises to God, sing praises;
\q1 sing praises to our King, sing praises.
\q
\v 7 For God is the King over all the earth;
\q1 sing praises with understanding.
\q
\v 8 God reigns over the nations;
\q1 God sits on his holy throne.

\d A song; a psalm of the sons of Korah.
\q
\v 1 Great is Yahweh and greatly to be praised,
\q1 in the city of our God on his holy mountain.
\q
\v 2 Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth,
\q1 is Mount Zion, on the sides of the north,
\q1 the city of the great King.
\q
\v 3 God has made himself known in her palaces as a refuge.
\q
\v 4 For, see, the kings assembled themselves;
\q1 they passed by together.
\q
\v 5 They saw it, then they were amazed;
\q1 they were dismayed, and they hurried away.
\q
\v 6 Trembling took hold of them there,
\q1 pain as when a woman is in labor.
\q
\v 7 With the east wind
\q1 you break the ships of Tarshish.
\q
\v 8 As we have heard, so have we seen
\q1 in the city of Yahweh of hosts, in the city of our God;
\q1 God will establish it forever. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 9 We have thought about your covenant faithfulness, God,
\q1 in the middle of your temple.
\q

\q1 your right hand is full of righteousness.
\q
\v 11 Let Mount Zion be glad,
\q1 let the daughters of Judah rejoice
\q1 because of your righteous decrees.
\q
\v 12 Walk around Mount Zion, go round about her;
\q1 count her towers,
\q
\v 13 notice well her walls,
\q1 and look at her palaces
\q1 so that you may tell it to the next generation.

\d For the chief musician. A psalm of the sons of Korah.
\q
\v 1 Hear this, all you peoples;
\q1 give ear, all you inhabitants of the world,
\q
\v 2 both low and high,
\q1 rich and poor together.
\q
\v 3 My mouth will speak wisdom
\q1 and the meditation of my heart will be of understanding.
\q
\v 4 I will incline my ear to a parable;
\q1 I will begin my parable with the harp.
\q
\v 5 Why should I fear the days of evil,
\q1 when iniquity surrounds me at my heels?
\q
\v 6 Why should I fear those who trust in their wealth
\q1 and boast about the amount of their riches?
\q
\v 7 It is certain that no one can redeem his brother
\q1 or give God a ransom for him,
\q
\v 8 For the redemption of one's life is costly,
\q1 and no one can pay what we owe.
\q
\v 9 No one can live forever
\q1 so that his body should not decay.
\q
\v 10 For he will see decay. Wise men die;
\q1 the fool and the brute alike perish
\q1 and leave their wealth to others.
\q
\v 11 Their inner thought is that their families will continue forever,
\q1 and the places where they live, to all generations;
\q1 they call their lands after their own names.
\q
\v 12 But man, having wealth, does not remain alive;
\q1 he is like the beasts that perish.
\q
\v 13 This, their way, is their folly;
\q1 yet after them, men approve of their sayings. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 14 Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol,
\q1 and death will be their shepherd.
\q1 The upright will rule over them in the morning,
\q1 and their bodies will be consumed in Sheol,
\q1 with no place for them to live.
\q
\v 15 But God will redeem my life from the power of Sheol;
\q1 he will receive me. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 16 Do not be afraid when one becomes rich,
\q1 and the glory of his house increases.
\q
\v 17 For when he dies he will take nothing away;
\q1 his glory will not go down after him.
\q
\v 18 He blessed his soul while he lived—
\q1 and men praise you when you live for yourself—
\q
\v 19 he will go to the generation of his fathers
\q1 and they will never see the light again.
\q
\v 20 One who has wealth but no understanding
\q1 is like the beasts, which perish.

\v 1 The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, has spoken
\q1 and called the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.
\q
\v 2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,
\q1 God has shone.
\q
\v 3 Our God comes and does not stay silent;
\q1 a fire devours before him,
\q1 and it is very stormy around him.
\q
\v 4 He calls to the heavens above
\q1 and to the earth so that he may judge his people:
\q
\v 5 "Gather my faithful ones together to me,
\q1 those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice."
\q
\v 6 The heavens will declare his righteousness,
\q1 for God himself is judge. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 7 "Hear, my people, and I will speak;
\q1 I am God, your God.
\q
\v 8 I will not reprove you for your sacrifices;
\q1 your burnt offerings are always before me.
\q
\v 9 I will take no bull out of your house,
\q1 or male goats out of your folds.
\q
\v 10 For every beast of the forest is mine,
\q1 and the cattle on a thousand hills.
\q
\v 11 I know all the birds of the mountains,
\q1 and the wild beasts of the field are mine.
\q
\v 12 If I were hungry, I would not tell you;
\q1 for the world is mine, and everything in it.
\q
\v 13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls
\q1 or drink the blood of goats?
\q
\v 14 Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving,
\q1 and pay your vows to the Most High.
\q
\v 15 Call on me in the day of trouble;
\q1 I will rescue you, and you will glorify me."
\q
\v 16 But to the wicked God says,
\q1 "What have you to do with declaring my statutes,
\q1 that you have taken my covenant in your mouth,
\q
\v 17 since you hate instruction
\q1 and throw my words away?
\q
\v 18 When you see a thief, you agree with him;
\q1 you participate with those who commit adultery.
\q
\v 19 You give your mouth to evil,
\q1 and your tongue expresses deceit.
\q
\v 20 You sit and speak against your brother;
\q1 you slander your own mother's son.
\q
\v 21 You have done these things, but I have kept silent,
\q1 so you thought that I was someone just like yourself.
\q1 But I will reprove you and bring up, right before your eyes, all the things you have done.
\q
\v 22 Give this careful consideration, you who forget God,
\q1 otherwise I will tear you to pieces,
\q1 and there will be no one to come to help you!
\q
\v 23 The one who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving praises me,
\q1 and to anyone who plans his path in the right way
\q1 I will show God's salvation."

\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David; when Nathan the prophet came to him after he had slept with Bathsheba.
\q
\v 1 Have mercy on me, God, because of your covenant faithfulness;
\q1 for the sake of the multitude of your merciful actions, blot out my transgressions.
\q
\v 2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity
\q1 and cleanse me from my sin.
\q
\v 3 For I know my transgressions,
\q1 and my sin is always before me.
\q
\v 4 Against you, you only, I have sinned
\q1 and done what is evil in your sight;
\q1 you are right when you speak;
\q1 you are correct when you judge.
\q
\v 5 See, I was born in iniquity;
\q1 as soon as my mother conceived me, I was in sin.
\q
\v 6 See, you desire trustworthiness in my inner self;
\q1 and you teach me wisdom in the secret place within.
\q
\v 7 Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean;
\q1 wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
\q
\v 8 Make me hear joy and gladness
\q1 so that the bones that you have broken may rejoice.
\q
\v 9 Hide your face from my sins
\q1 and blot out all my iniquities.
\q
\v 10 Create in me a clean heart, God,
\q1 and renew a right spirit within me.
\q
\v 11 Do not drive me away from your presence,
\q1 and do not take your holy Spirit from me.
\q
\v 12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation,
\q1 and sustain me with a willing spirit.
\q
\v 13 Then will I teach transgressors your ways,
\q1 and sinners will be converted to you.
\q
\v 14 Forgive me for shedding blood, God of my salvation,
\q1 and I will shout for the joy of your righteousness.
\q
\v 15 Lord, open my lips,
\q1 and my mouth will express your praise.
\q
\v 16 For you do not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it;
\q1 you have no pleasure in burnt offerings.
\q
\v 17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.
\q1 You, God, will not despise a broken and a contrite heart.
\q
\v 18 Do good in your good pleasure to Zion;
\q1 rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
\q
\v 19 Then will you delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,
\q1 in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings;
\q1 then our people will offer bulls on your altar.

\q
\v 1 Why are you proud of making trouble, you mighty man?
\q1 The covenant faithfulness of God comes every day.
\q
\v 2 Your tongue plans destruction
\q1 like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
\q
\v 3 You love evil more than good
\q1 and lying rather than speaking righteousness. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 You love all words that devour others,

\q
\v 5 God will likewise destroy you forever;
\q1 he will take you up and pluck you out of your tent
\q1 and root you out of the land of the living. \qs Selah\qs*
\q

\v 7 "See, this is a man who did not make God his refuge,
\q1 but he trusted in the abundance of his wealth,
\q1 and he was strong when he destroyed others."
\q
\v 8 But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God's house;

\q
\v 1 A fool says in his heart, "There is no God."
\q1 They are corrupt and have done abominable iniquity;
\q1 there is no one who does good.
\q
\v 2 God looks down from heaven on the children of mankind
\q1 to see if there are any who understand,
\q1 who seek after him.
\q
\v 3 They have all turned away. Together they have become corrupt.
\q1 There is not one who does good, not even one.
\q
\v 4 Do those who commit iniquity have no understanding—
\q1 those who devour my people as if they were eating bread
\q1 and they do not call on God?
\q
\v 5 They were in great fear, although no reason to fear was there;
\q1 for God will scatter the bones of whoever will camp against you;
\q1 such people will be put to shame because God has rejected them.
\q

\q1 When God brings back his people from the captivity,

\q
\v 2 Hear my prayer, God;

\q1 the Lord is the one who upholds me.
\q
\v 5 He will repay my enemies with evil;
\q1 in your faithfulness, destroy them!
\q
\v 6 I will sacrifice to you with a freewill offering;

\q
\v 1 Give ear to my prayer, God;

\q
\v 2 Pay attention to me and answer me;
\q1 I have no rest in my troubles
\q
\v 3 because of the voice of my enemies,
\q1 because of the oppression of the wicked;
\q1 for they bring trouble on me
\q1 and persecute me in anger.
\q
\v 4 My heart trembles within me,
\q1 and the terrors of death have fallen on me.
\q
\v 5 Fearfulness and trembling have come on me,
\q1 and horror has overwhelmed me.
\q
\v 6 I said, "Oh, if only I had wings like a dove!
\q1 Then would I fly away and be at rest.
\q
\v 7 See, then I would wander far away;
\q1 I would stay in the wilderness. \qs Selah\qs*
\q

\q
\v 9 Devour them, Lord, confuse their language!
\q1 For I have seen violence and strife in the city.
\q
\v 10 Day and night they go about on its walls;
\q1 iniquity and mischief are in the middle of it.
\q
\v 11 Wickedness is in the middle of it;
\q1 oppression and deceit do not leave its streets.
\q
\v 12 For it was not an enemy who rebuked me,
\q1 then I could have borne it;
\q1 neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me,
\q1 then I would have hidden myself from him.
\q
\v 13 But it was you, a man equal to myself,
\q1 my companion and my close friend.
\q
\v 14 We had sweet fellowship together;
\q1 we walked in the house of God with the throng.
\q
\v 15 Let death come suddenly on them;
\q1 let them go down alive to Sheol,
\q1 for wickedness is where they live, right among them.
\q
\v 16 As for me, I will call on God,
\q1 and Yahweh will save me.
\q
\v 17 In the evening, morning and at noonday I complain and moan;
\q1 he will hear my voice.
\q
\v 18 He will safely rescue my life from the battle that was against me,
\q1 for those who fought against me were many.
\q
\v 19 God, the one who rules from eternity,
\q1 will hear them and humiliate them.\qs Selah\qs*
\q1 They never change,
\q1 and they do not fear God.
\q
\v 20 My friend has raised his hands against those who were at peace with him;
\q1 he has not respected the covenant that he had.
\q
\v 21 His mouth was smooth as butter,
\q1 but his heart was hostile;
\q1 his words were softer than oil,
\q1 yet they were actually drawn swords.
\q
\v 22 Place your burdens on Yahweh, and he will sustain you;
\q1 he will never allow a righteous person to totter.
\q
\v 23 But you, God, will bring the wicked down into the pit of destruction;
\q1 bloodthirsty and deceitful men will not live even half as long as others,

\q

\q
\v 3 When I am afraid,
\q1 I will put my trust in you.

\q1 in God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid;

\q1 all their thoughts are against me for evil.
\q
\v 6 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves,

\q
\v 7 Do not let them escape doing iniquity.
\q1 Bring down the peoples in your anger, God.
\q
\v 8 You number my wanderings
\q1 and put my tears into your bottle;

\q1 What can anyone do to me?
\q
\v 12 The duty to fulfill my vows to you is on me, God;
\q1 I will give thank offerings to you.

\v 1 Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to me,
\q1 for I take refuge in you until these troubles are over.
\q1 I stay under your wings for protection until this destruction is over.
\q
\v 2 I will cry to God Most High,
\q1 to God, who does all things for me.
\q
\v 3 He will send help from heaven and save me,
\q1 he is angry with those who crush me. \qs Selah\qs*
\q1 God will send me his loving kindness and his faithfulness.
\q
\v 4 My life is among lions;
\q1 I am among those who are ready to devour me.
\q1 I am among people whose teeth are spears and arrows,
\q1 and whose tongues are sharp swords.
\q
\v 5 Be exalted, God, above the heavens;
\q1 let your glory be above all the earth.
\q
\v 6 They spread out a net for my feet;

\q1 They dug a pit in front of me.
\q1 They themselves have fallen into the middle of it! \qs Selah\qs*

\v 9 I will give thanks to you, Lord, among the peoples;

\q
\v 1 Do you rulers speak righteousness?
\q1 Do you judge uprightly, you people?
\q
\v 2 No, you commit wickedness in your heart;
\q1 you distribute violence throughout the land with your hands.
\q
\v 3 The wicked go astray even when they are in the womb;
\q1 they go astray from birth, speaking lies.
\q
\v 4 Their poison is like a snake's poison;
\q1 they are like a deaf adder that stops up its ears,
\q
\v 5 that pays no attention to the voice of charmers,
\q1 no matter how skillful they are.
\q
\v 6 Break their teeth in their mouths, God;
\q1 break out the great teeth of the young lions, Yahweh.
\q
\v 7 Let them melt away as water that runs off;
\q1 when they shoot their arrows, let them be as though they had no points.
\q
\v 8 Let them be like a snail that melts and passes away,
\q1 like the untimely-born child of a woman that never sees the sunlight.
\q
\v 9 Before your pots can feel the thorn's burning heat,
\q1 he will take them away with a whirlwind, the green thorns and the burning thorns alike.
\q

\q
\v 2 Keep me safe from the workers of iniquity,

\q
\v 3 For, see, they wait in ambush to take my life.
\q1 The powerful men gather themselves together against me,
\q1 but not because of my transgression or my sin, Yahweh.
\q
\v 4 They prepare to run at me although I am without fault;

\q
\v 5 You, Yahweh God of hosts, the God of Israel,

\q
\v 8 But you, Yahweh, laugh at them;

\q1 Scatter them by your power and make them fall, Lord our shield.
\q
\v 12 For the sins of their mouths and the words of their lips,
\q1 let them be captured in their pride,
\q1 and for the curses and lies that they express.
\q
\v 13 Consume them in wrath, consume them so that they will be no more;
\q1 let them know that God rules in Jacob
\q1 and to the ends of the earth. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 14 At evening they return,
\q1 howling like dogs going around the city.

\q
\v 16 But I will sing about your strength,
\q1 and in the morning I will sing about your steadfast love!
\q1 For you have been my high tower

\q
\v 1 God, you have cast us off; you have broken through our defenses;
\q1 you have been angry; restore us again.
\q
\v 2 You have made the land tremble; you have torn it apart;
\q1 heal its fissures, for it is shaking.
\q
\v 3 You have made your people see difficult things;
\q1 you have made us drink the wine of staggering.
\q
\v 4 For those who honor you,
\q1 you have set up a banner
\q1 to be displayed against those who carry the bow. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 So that those you love may be rescued,

\q
\v 6 God has spoken in his holiness, "I will rejoice;

\q
\v 7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine;
\q1 Ephraim also is my helmet;
\q1 Judah is my scepter.

\v 10 But you, God, have you not rejected us?
\q1 You do not go into battle with our army.

\q
\v 5 For you, God, have heard my vows,

\q1 he is my high tower; I will not be greatly moved.
\q
\v 3 How long, all of you, will you attack a man,
\q1 that you may tip him over
\q1 like a leaning wall or a shaky fence?
\q
\v 4 They consult with him only to bring him down from his honorable position;
\q1 they love to tell lies;
\q1 they bless him with their mouths, but in their hearts they curse him. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 I wait in silence for God alone;

\v 8 Trust in him at all times, you people;
\q1 pour out your heart before him;
\q1 God is a refuge for us. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 9 Surely men of low standing are vanity, and men of high standing are a lie;

\q1 weighed together, they are lighter than nothing.
\q
\v 10 Do not trust in oppression or robbery;
\q1 and do not hope uselessly in riches,
\q1 for they will bear no fruit; do not fix your heart on them.
\q
\v 11 God has spoken once,
\q1 twice have I heard this:

\q
\v 2 So I have looked on you in the sanctuary,
\q1 to see your power and your glory.
\q
\v 3 Because your covenant faithfulness is better than life,
\q1 my lips will praise you.
\q
\v 4 So I will bless you while I live;
\q1 I will lift up my hands in your name.
\q
\v 5 It will be as if I ate a meal of marrow and fatness;
\q1 with joyful lips my mouth will praise you,
\q
\v 6 when I think about you on my bed
\q1 and meditate on you in the night hours.
\q
\v 7 For you have been my help,
\q1 and in the shadow of your wings I rejoice.
\q
\v 8 I cling to you;
\q1 your right hand supports me.
\q
\v 9 But those who seek to destroy my life
\q1 will go down into the lowest parts of the earth;
\v 10 they will be given over to those whose hands use the sword,
\q1 and they will become food for the jackals.

\q
\v 2 Hide me from the secret plotting of evildoers,
\q1 from the commotion of the doers of iniquity.
\q
\v 3 They have sharpened their tongues like swords;
\q1 they have aimed their arrows, bitter words,
\q
\v 4 so that they may shoot from secret places at someone who is innocent;
\q1 suddenly they shoot at him and fear nothing.
\q
\v 5 They encourage themselves in an evil plan;
\q1 they consult privately together in order to set traps;
\q1 they say, "Who will see us?"
\q
\v 6 They invent sinful plans;
\q1 "We have finished," they say, "a careful plan."
\q1 The inner thoughts and hearts of man are deep.
\q
\v 7 But God will shoot them;
\q1 suddenly they will be wounded with his arrows.
\q
\v 8 They will be made to stumble, since their own tongues are against them;
\q1 all who see them will wag their heads.
\q
\v 9 All people will fear
\q1 and will declare God's deeds.
\q1 They will wisely think about what he has done.

\q1 the roaring of their waves,

\q1 you make the east and the west rejoice.
\q

\q1 the river of God is full of water;
\q1 you provide mankind grain when you have prepared the earth.

\q
\v 13 I will come into your house with burnt offerings;
\q1 I will pay you my vows
\q

\v 9 You, God, sent a plentiful rain;
\q1 you strengthened your inheritance when it was weary.

\v 10 Your people lived in it;

\q
\v 12-13 Kings of armies flee, they flee,

\q1 When some of you people stayed among the sheepfolds, why did you do this?
\q

\q
\v 1 Save me, God;

\q
\v 2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no place to stand;
\q1 I have come into deep waters, where the floods flow over me.
\q
\v 3 I am weary with my crying; my throat is dry;
\q1 my eyes fail while I wait for my God.
\q
\v 4 Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs on my head;
\q1 those who would cut me off, being my enemies for wrong reasons, are mighty;
\q1 what I did not steal, I have to give back.
\q
\v 5 God, you know my foolishness,
\q1 and my sins are not hidden from you.
\q
\v 6 Let not those who hope in you be put to shame because of me, Lord Yahweh of hosts;
\q1 let not those who seek you be brought to dishonor because of me, God of Israel.
\q
\v 7 For your sake I have borne rebuke;
\q1 shame has covered my face.
\q
\v 8 I have become a stranger to my brothers,
\q1 an alien to my mother's children.
\q
\v 9 For the zeal of your house has eaten me up,
\q1 and the rebukes of those who rebuke you have fallen on me.
\q
\v 10 When I wept and did not eat food,
\q1 they insulted me.
\q
\v 11 When I made sackcloth my clothing,
\q1 I became the object of a proverb to them.

\q1 I am a song of drunkards.
\q

\q1 answer me in the trustworthiness of your salvation.
\q

\q1 neither let the deep swallow me up.
\q1 Do not let the pit shut its mouth on me.

\q1 when they think they are in safety, let it become a trap.
\q
\v 23 Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see;
\q1 and always make their loins shake.
\q
\v 24 Pour out your indignation on them,
\q1 and let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.
\q
\v 25 Let their place be a desolation;
\q1 let no one live in their tents.
\q
\v 26 For they persecuted the one you struck down.
\q1 They repeated the account of the pain of those you have wounded.
\q
\v 27 Accuse them of having committed iniquity after iniquity;
\q1 do not let them come into your righteous victory.
\q
\v 28 Let them be blotted out of the Book of Life
\q1 and not be written down along with the righteous.
\q
\v 29 But I am poor and sorrowful;
\q1 let your salvation, God, set me up on high.
\q
\v 30 I will praise the name of God with a song
\q1 and will exalt him with thanksgiving.
\q
\v 31 That will please Yahweh better than an ox
\q1 or a bull that has horns and hooves.
\q
\v 32 The meek have seen it and are glad;
\q1 you who seek after God, let your hearts live.
\q
\v 33 For Yahweh hears the needy
\q1 and does not despise his prisoners.
\q
\v 34 Let heaven and earth praise him,
\q1 the seas and everything that moves in them.
\q
\v 35 For God will save Zion and will rebuild the cities of Judah;
\q1 the people will live there and have it as a possession.
\q
\v 36 His servants' descendants will inherit it;
\q1 and those who love his name will live there.

\q
\v 1 Save me, God!
\q1 Yahweh, come quickly and help me.
\q
\v 2 Let those who try to take my life
\q1 be ashamed and humiliated;
\q1 let them be turned back and brought to dishonor,
\q1 those who take pleasure in my pain.
\q
\v 3 Let them be turned back because of their shame,
\q1 those who say, "Aha, aha."
\q
\v 4 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you;
\q1 let those who love your salvation always say,
\q1 "May God be praised."
\q
\v 5 But I am poor and needy;
\q1 hurry to me, God;
\q1 you are my help and you rescue me.
\q1 Yahweh, do not delay.
\c 71
\m
\q
\v 1 In you, Yahweh, I take refuge;
\q1 let me never be put to shame.
\q
\v 2 Rescue me and make me safe in your righteousness;
\q1 turn your ear to me and save me.
\q
\v 3 Be to me a rock for refuge where I may always go;
\q1 you have given a command to save me,
\q1 for you are my rock and my fortress.
\q
\v 4 Rescue me, my God, out of the hand of the wicked,
\q1 out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel.
\q
\v 5 For you are my hope, Lord Yahweh.
\q1 I have trusted in you ever since I was a child.
\q
\v 6 By you I have been supported from the womb;
\q1 you are he who took me out of my mother's belly;
\q1 my praise will be always about you.
\q
\v 7 I am an example to many people;
\q1 you are my strong refuge.
\q
\v 8 My mouth will be filled with your praise,
\q1 all the day with your honor.
\q
\v 9 Do not throw me away in my time of old age;
\q1 do not abandon me when my strength fails.
\q
\v 10 For my enemies are talking about me;
\q1 those who watch for my life are plotting together.
\q
\v 11 They say, "God has forsaken him;
\q1 pursue and take him, for there is no one to save him."
\q
\v 12 God, do not be far from me;
\q1 my God, hurry to help me.
\q
\v 13 Let them be put to shame and destroyed, those who are hostile to my life;
\q1 let them be covered with rebuke and dishonor, those who seek my hurt.
\q
\v 14 But I will always hope in you
\q1 and will praise you more and more.
\q
\v 15 My mouth will tell about your righteousness
\q1 and your salvation all the day,
\q1 although I cannot understand it.
\q
\v 16 I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Yahweh;
\q1 I will make mention of your righteousness, yours alone.
\q
\v 17 God, you have taught me from my youth;
\q1 even now I declare your wonderful deeds.
\q
\v 18 Indeed, even when I am old and gray-headed, God, do not forsake me,
\q1 as I have been declaring your strength to the next generation,
\q1 your power to everyone who is to come.
\q
\v 19 Your righteousness also, God, is very high;
\q1 you who have done great things, God, who is like you?
\q
\v 20 You who made me see many troubles
\q1 will revive us again
\q1 and will bring us up again from the depths of the earth.
\q
\v 21 May you increase my honor;
\q1 turn again and comfort me.
\q
\v 22 I will also give thanks to you with the harp
\q1 for your trustworthiness, my God;
\q1 to you I will sing praises with the harp,
\q1 Holy One of Israel.
\q
\v 23 My lips will shout for joy when I sing praises to you—
\q1 even my soul, which you have redeemed.
\q
\v 24 My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long;
\q1 for they have been put to shame and are confused, those who sought my hurt.
\c 72
\m
\d A psalm of Solomon.
\q
\v 1 Give the king your righteous decrees, God,
\q1 your righteousness to the king's son.
\q
\v 2 May he judge your people with righteousness
\q1 and your poor with justice.
\q
\v 3 May the mountains produce peace for the people;
\q1 may the hills produce righteousness.
\q
\v 4 May he judge the poor of the people;
\q1 may he save the children of the needy
\q1 and break in pieces the oppressor.
\q
\v 5 May they honor you while the sun endures,
\q1 and as long as the moon lasts throughout all generations.
\q
\v 6 May he come down like rain on the mown grass,
\q1 like showers that water the earth.
\q
\v 7 May the righteous flourish in his days,
\q1 and may there be an abundance of peace till the moon is no more.
\q
\v 8 May he have dominion from sea to sea,
\q1 and from the River to the ends of the earth.
\q
\v 9 May those who live in the wilderness bow down before him;
\q1 may his enemies lick the dust.
\q
\v 10 May the kings of Tarshish and of the islands render tribute;
\q1 may the kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts.
\q
\v 11 Indeed, may all kings fall down before him;
\q1 may all nations serve him.
\q
\v 12 For he helps the needy person who cries out
\q1 and the poor person who has no other helper.
\q
\v 13 He has pity on the poor and needy,
\q1 and he saves the lives of needy people.
\q
\v 14 He redeems their lives from oppression and violence,
\q1 and their blood is precious in his sight.
\q
\v 15 May he live! May the gold of Sheba be given to him.
\q1 May people always pray for him;
\q1 may God bless him all day long.
\q
\v 16 May there be abundance of grain in the land;
\q1 on the mountaintops may their crops wave.
\q1 May the fruit of it be like Lebanon;
\q1 may the people flourish in the cities like the grass of the field.
\q
\v 17 May his name endure forever;
\q1 may his name continue as long as the sun;
\q1 may people be blessed in him;
\q1 may all nations call him blessed.
\q
\v 18 May Yahweh God, the God of Israel, be blessed,
\q1 who alone does wonderful things.
\q
\v 19 May his glorious name be blessed forever,
\q1 and may the whole earth be filled with his glory.
\q1 Amen and Amen.

\c 73
\m
\d A psalm of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 Surely God is good to Israel,
\q1 to those with a pure heart.
\q
\v 2 But as for me, my feet almost slipped;
\q1 my feet almost slipped out from under me
\q
\v 3 because I was envious of the arrogant
\q1 when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
\q
\v 4 For they have no pain until their death,
\q1 but they are strong and well fed.
\q
\v 5 They are free from the burdens of other men;
\q1 they are not afflicted like other men.
\q
\v 6 Pride adorns them like a necklace around their neck;
\q1 violence clothes them like a robe.
\q
\v 7 Out of such blindness comes sin;
\q1 evil thoughts pass through their hearts.
\q
\v 8 They mock and speak wickedly;
\q1 in their arrogance they threaten oppression.
\q
\v 9 They set their mouth against the heavens,
\q1 and their tongues march through the earth.
\q
\v 10 Therefore his people turn to them
\q1 and abundant waters are drained out.
\q
\v 11 They say, "How does God know?
\q1 Is there knowledge with the Most High?"
\q
\v 12 Take notice: these people are wicked;
\q1 they are always carefree, becoming richer and richer.
\q
\v 13 Surely it is in vain that I have guarded my heart
\q1 and washed my hands in innocence.
\q
\v 14 For all the day long I have been afflicted
\q1 and disciplined every morning.
\q
\v 15 If I had said, "I will say these things,"
\q1 then I would have betrayed this generation of your children.
\q
\v 16 Though I tried to understand these things,
\q1 it was too difficult for me.
\q
\v 17 Then I went into God's sanctuary
\q1 and came to understand their fate.
\q
\v 18 Surely you put them in slippery places;
\q1 you bring them down to ruin.
\q
\v 19 How they become a wilderness in a moment!
\q1 They come to an end and are finished in awful terrors.
\q
\v 20 They are like a dream after one wakes up;
\q2 Lord, when you arise, you will think nothing of those dreams.
\q
\v 21 For my heart was grieved,
\q1 and I was deeply wounded.
\q
\v 22 I was ignorant and lacked insight;
\q1 I was like a senseless animal before you.
\q
\v 23 Yet I am always with you;
\q1 you hold my right hand.
\q
\v 24 You will guide me with your advice
\q1 and afterward receive me to glory.
\q
\v 25 Whom have I in heaven but you?
\q1 There is no one on earth that I desire but you.
\q
\v 26 My flesh and my heart grow weak,
\q1 but God is the strength of my heart forever.
\q
\v 27 Those who are far from you will perish;
\q1 you will destroy all those who are unfaithful to you.
\q
\v 28 But as for me, all I need to do is to approach God.
\q1 I have made the Lord Yahweh my refuge.
\q1 I will declare all your deeds.
\c 74
\m
\d A maschil of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 God, why have you rejected us forever?
\q1 Why does your anger burn against the sheep of your pasture?
\q
\v 2 Call to mind your people, whom you purchased in ancient times,
\q1 the tribe whom you have redeemed to be your own heritage,
\q1 and Mount Zion, where you live.
\q
\v 3 Come look at the complete ruins,
\q1 all the damage that the enemy has done in the holy place.
\q
\v 4 Your adversaries roared in the middle of your appointed place;
\q1 they set up their battle flags.
\q
\v 5 They hacked away with axes
\q1 as in a thick forest.
\q
\v 6 They smashed and broke down all the engravings;
\q1 they broke them with axes and hammers.
\q
\v 7 They set your sanctuary on fire;
\q1 they desecrated where you live, knocking it to the ground.
\q
\v 8 They said in their hearts, "We will destroy them all."
\q1 They burned up all of your meeting places in the land.
\q
\v 9 We do not see any more signs;
\q1 there is no prophet any more,
\q1 and no one among us knows how long this will last.
\q
\v 10 How long, God, will the enemy throw insults at you?
\q1 Will the enemy blaspheme your name forever?
\q
\v 11 Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand?
\q1 Take your right hand from your garment and destroy them.
\q
\v 12 Yet God has been my king from ancient times,
\q1 bringing salvation on the earth.
\q
\v 13 You divided the sea by your strength;
\q1 you smashed the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.
\q
\v 14 You crushed the heads of leviathan;
\q1 you fed him to those living in the wilderness.
\q
\v 15 You broke open springs and streams;
\q1 you dried up flowing rivers.
\q
\v 16 The day is yours, and the night is yours also;
\q1 you set the sun and moon in place.
\q
\v 17 You have set all the borders of the earth;
\q1 you have made summer and winter.
\q
\v 18 Call to mind how the enemy hurled insults at you, Yahweh,
\q1 and that a foolish people has blasphemed your name.
\q
\v 19 Do not give the life of your dove to a wild animal.
\q1 Do not forget forever the life of your oppressed people.
\q
\v 20 Remember your covenant,
\q1 for the dark regions of the land are full of places of violence.
\q
\v 21 Do not let the oppressed be turned back in shame;
\q1 let the poor and oppressed praise your name.
\q
\v 22 Arise, God; defend your own honor;
\q1 call to mind how fools insult you all day long.
\q
\v 23 Do not forget the voice of your adversaries
\q1 or the uproar of those who continually defy you.

\d For the chief musician; set to Al Tashheth. A psalm of Asaph, a song.
\q
\v 1 We give thanks to you, God;
\q1 we give thanks, for you reveal your presence;
\q1 people tell of your wondrous works.
\q
\v 2 At the appointed time I will judge fairly.
\q
\v 3 Though the earth and all the inhabitants shake in fear,
\q1 I make steady the earth's pillars. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 I said to the arrogant, "Do not be arrogant,"
\q1 and to the wicked, "Do not lift up the horn.
\q
\v 5 Do not lift up your horn to the heights;
\q1 do not speak with an insolent neck."
\q
\v 6 It is not from the east or from the west,
\q1 and it is not from the wilderness that lifting up comes.
\q
\v 7 But God is the judge;
\q1 he brings down and he lifts up.
\q
\v 8 For Yahweh holds in his hand a cup of foaming wine,
\q1 which is mixed with spices, and pours it out.
\q1 Surely all the wicked of the earth will drink it to the last drop.
\q
\v 9 But I will continually tell what you have done;
\q1 I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
\q
\v 10 He says, "I will cut off all the horns of the wicked,
\q1 but the horns of the righteous will be raised up."
\c 76
\m
\d For the chief musician, on stringed instruments. A psalm of Asaph, a song.
\q
\v 1 God has made himself known in Judah;
\q1 his name is great in Israel.
\q
\v 2 His tent is in Salem;
\q1 his dwelling place is in Zion.
\q
\v 3 There he broke the arrows of the bow,
\q1 the shield, the sword, and the other weapons of war. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 You shine brightly and reveal your glory,
\q1 as you descend from the mountains, where you killed your victims.
\q
\v 5 The bravehearted were plundered;
\q1 they fell asleep.
\q1 All the warriors were helpless.
\q
\v 6 At your rebuke, God of Jacob,
\q1 both rider and horse fell asleep.
\q
\v 7 You, yes you, are to be feared;
\q1 who can stand in your sight when you are angry?
\q
\v 8 From heaven you made your judgment heard;
\q1 the earth was afraid and silent
\q
\v 9 when you, God, arose to execute judgment
\q1 and to save all the oppressed of the earth. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 10 Surely your angry judgment against humanity will bring you praise;
\q1 you gird yourself with what is left of your anger.
\q
\v 11 Make vows to Yahweh your God and keep them.
\q1 May all who surround him bring gifts to him who is to be feared.
\q
\v 12 He cuts off the spirit of the princes;
\q1 he is feared by the kings of the earth.

\d For the chief musician; after the manner of Jeduthun. A psalm of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 I will call out with my voice to God;
\q1 I will call with my voice to God, and my God will hear me.
\q
\v 2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord;
\q1 at night I stretched my hands out, and they would not become tired.
\q1 My soul refused to be comforted.
\q
\v 3 I thought of God as I groaned;
\q1 I thought about him as I grew faint. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 You held my eyes open;
\q1 I was too troubled to speak.
\q
\v 5 I thought about the days of old,
\q1 about times long past.
\q
\v 6 During the night I called to mind the song I once sang.
\q1 I thought carefully
\q1 and tried to understand what had happened.
\q
\v 7 Will the Lord reject me forever?
\q1 Will he never again show me favor?
\q
\v 8 Was his covenant faithfulness gone forever?
\q1 Had his promise failed forever?
\q
\v 9 Had God forgotten to be gracious?
\q1 Had his anger shut off his compassion? \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 10 I said, "This is my sorrow:
\q1 the changing of the right hand of the Most High toward us."
\q
\v 11 But I will call to mind your deeds, Yahweh;
\q1 I will think about your wonderful deeds of old.
\q
\v 12 I will ponder all your deeds
\q1 and will reflect on them.
\q
\v 13 Your way, God, is holy;
\q1 what god compares to our great God?
\q
\v 14 You are the God who does wonders;
\q1 you have revealed your strength among the peoples.
\q
\v 15 You gave your people victory by your great power—
\q1 the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 16 The waters saw you, God;
\q1 the waters saw you, and they were afraid;
\q1 the depths trembled.
\q
\v 17 The clouds poured down water;
\q1 the cloudy skies gave voice;
\q1 your arrows flew about.
\q
\v 18 Your thunderous voice was heard in the wind;
\q1 the lightning lit up the world;
\q1 the earth trembled and shook.
\q
\v 19 Your path went through the sea
\q1 and your way through the surging waters,
\q1 but your footprints were not seen.
\q
\v 20 You led your people like a flock
\q1 by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
\c 78
\m
\d A maschil of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 Hear my teaching, my people,
\q1 listen to the words of my mouth.
\q
\v 2 I will open my mouth in parables;
\q1 I will sing about hidden things about the past.
\q
\v 3 These are things that we have heard and learned,
\q1 things that our ancestors have told us.
\q
\v 4 We will not keep them from their descendants.
\q1 We will tell the next generation about the praiseworthy deeds of Yahweh,
\q1 his strength, and the wonders that he has done.
\q
\v 5 For he established covenant decrees in Jacob
\q1 and appointed a law in Israel.
\q1 He commanded our ancestors
\q1 that they were to teach them to their children.
\q
\v 6 He commanded this so that the generation to come might know his decrees, the children not yet born,
\q1 who should tell them in turn to their own children.
\q
\v 7 Then they would place their hope in God
\q1 and not forget his deeds
\q1 but keep his commandments.
\q
\v 8 Then they would not be like their ancestors,
\q1 who were a stubborn and rebellious generation,
\q1 a generation whose hearts were not right,
\q1 and whose spirits were not committed and faithful to God.
\q
\v 9 The Ephraimites were armed with bows,
\q1 but they turned back on the day of battle.
\q
\v 10 They did not keep the covenant with God,
\q1 and they refused to obey his law.
\q
\v 11 They forgot his deeds,
\q1 the wonderful things that he had shown them.
\q
\v 12 They forgot the marvelous things he did in the sight of their ancestors
\q1 in the land of Egypt, in the land of Zoan.
\q
\v 13 He divided the sea and led them across it;
\q1 he made the waters to stand like walls.
\q
\v 14 In the daytime he led them with a cloud
\q1 and all the night with the light of fire.
\q
\v 15 He split the rocks in the wilderness,
\q1 and he gave them water abundantly, enough to fill the depths of the sea.
\q
\v 16 He made streams flow out of the rock
\q1 and made the water flow like rivers.
\q
\v 17 Yet they continued to sin against him,
\q1 rebelling against the Most High in the wilderness.
\q
\v 18 They challenged God in their hearts
\q1 by asking for food to satisfy their appetites.
\q
\v 19 They spoke against God;
\q1 they said, "Can God really lay out a table for us in the wilderness?
\q
\v 20 See, when he struck the rock, waters gushed out
\q1 and streams overflowed.
\q1 But can he give bread also?
\q1 Will he provide meat for his people?"
\q
\v 21 When Yahweh heard this, he was angry;
\q1 so his fire burned against Jacob,
\q1 and his anger attacked Israel,
\q
\v 22 because they did not believe in God
\q1 and did not trust in his salvation.
\q
\v 23 Yet he commanded the skies above
\q1 and opened the doors of the sky.
\q
\v 24 He rained down manna for them to eat,
\q1 and gave them the grain from heaven.
\q
\v 25 People ate the bread of angels.
\q1 He sent them food in abundance.
\q
\v 26 He caused the east wind to blow in the sky,
\q1 and by his power he guided the south wind.
\q
\v 27 He rained down meat on them like dust,
\q1 birds as numerous as the sands of the sea.
\q
\v 28 They fell in the middle of their camp,
\q1 all around their tents.
\q
\v 29 So they ate and were full.
\q1 He gave them what they craved.
\q
\v 30 But they had not yet filled up;
\q1 their food was still in their mouths.
\q
\v 31 Then God's anger attacked them
\q1 and killed the strongest of them.
\q1 He brought down the young men of Israel.
\q
\v 32 Despite this, they continued to sin
\q1 and did not believe his wonderful deeds.
\q
\v 33 Therefore God cut short their days;
\q1 their years were filled with terror.
\q
\v 34 Whenever God afflicted them, they would start to seek him,
\q1 and they would return and look earnestly for him.
\q
\v 35 They would call to mind that God was their rock
\q1 and that the Most High God was their rescuer.
\q
\v 36 But they would flatter him with their mouth
\q1 and lie to him with their words.
\q
\v 37 For their hearts were not firmly fixed on him,
\q1 and they were not faithful to his covenant.
\q
\v 38 Yet he, being merciful, forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them.
\q1 Yes, many times he held back his anger
\q1 and did not stir up all his wrath.
\q
\v 39 He called to mind that they were made of flesh,
\q1 a wind that passes away and does not return.
\q
\v 40 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness
\q1 and grieved him in the barren regions!
\q
\v 41 Again and again they challenged God
\q1 and offended the Holy One of Israel.
\q
\v 42 They did not think about his power,
\q1 how he had rescued them from the enemy
\q
\v 43 when he performed his terrifying signs in Egypt
\q1 and his wonders in the region of Zoan.
\q
\v 44 He turned the Egyptians' rivers to blood
\q1 so that they could not drink from their streams.
\q
\v 45 He sent swarms of flies that devoured them
\q1 and frogs that overran their land.
\q
\v 46 He gave their crops to the grasshopper
\q1 and their labor to the locust.
\q
\v 47 He destroyed their vines with hail
\q1 and their sycamore trees with more hail.
\q
\v 48 He rained hail on their cattle
\q1 and hurled lightning bolts at their livestock.
\q
\v 49 The fierceness of his anger lashed out against them.
\q1 He sent wrath, fury, and trouble
\q1 like agents who bring disaster.
\q
\v 50 He leveled a path for his anger;
\q1 he did not spare them from death
\q1 but gave them over to the plague.
\q
\v 51 He killed all the firstborn in Egypt,
\q1 the firstborn of their strength in the tents of Ham.
\q
\v 52 He led his own people out like sheep
\q1 and guided them through the wilderness like a flock.
\q
\v 53 He led them secure and unafraid,
\q1 but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
\q
\v 54 Then he brought them to the border of his holy land,
\q1 to this mountain that his right hand acquired.
\q
\v 55 He drove out the nations from before them
\q1 and assigned them their inheritance.
\q1 He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.
\q
\v 56 Yet they challenged and defied the Most High God
\q1 and did not keep his solemn commands.
\q
\v 57 They were unfaithful and acted treacherously like their fathers;
\q1 they were as undependable as a faulty bow.
\q
\v 58 For they made him angry with their high places
\q1 and provoked him to jealous anger with their idols.
\q
\v 59 When God heard this, he was angry
\q1 and completely rejected Israel.

\q
\v 1 God, foreign nations have come into your inheritance;
\q1 they have defiled your holy temple;
\q1 they have turned Jerusalem into a heap of ruins.
\q
\v 2 They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the skies,
\q1 the bodies of your faithful people to the beasts of the earth.
\q
\v 3 They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem,
\q1 and there was none to bury them.
\q
\v 4 We have become a reproach for our neighbors,
\q1 mocking and derision to those who are around us.
\q
\v 5 How long, Yahweh? Will you stay angry forever?
\q1 How long will your jealous anger burn like fire?
\q
\v 6 Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not know you
\q1 and on the kingdoms that do not call upon your name.
\q
\v 7 For they have devoured Jacob
\q1 and destroyed his villages.
\q
\v 8 Do not hold the sins of our forefathers against us;
\q1 may your merciful actions come to us,
\q1 for we are very low.
\q
\v 9 Help us, God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of your name;
\q1 save us and forgive our sins for your name's sake.
\q
\v 10 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?"
\q1 May the blood of your servants that was shed
\q1 be avenged on the nations before our eyes.
\q
\v 11 May the groans of the prisoners come before you;
\q1 with the greatness of your power keep the children of death alive.
\q
\v 12 Pay back into the laps of our neighboring countries seven times as much
\q1 as the insults with which they have insulted you, Lord.
\q

\v 13 Oh, that my people would listen to me;

\q1 but even our best years are marked by trouble and sorrow.
\q1 Yes, they pass quickly, and we fly away.
\q
\v 11 Who knows the intensity of your anger,
\q1 and your wrath that is equal to the fear of you?
\q
\v 12 So teach us to consider our life
\q1 so that we might live wisely.
\q
\v 13 Turn back, Yahweh! How long will it be?
\q1 Have pity on your servants.
\q
\v 14 Satisfy us in the morning with your covenant faithfulness
\q1 so that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
\q
\v 15 Make us glad in proportion to the days you afflicted us
\q1 and to the years we have experienced trouble.
\q
\v 16 Let your servants see your work,
\q1 and let our children see your majesty.
\q
\v 17 May the favor of the Lord our God be ours;
\q1 prosper the work of our hands;
\q1 indeed, prosper the work of our hands.

\q
\v 1 He who lives in the shelter of the Most High
\q1 will stay in the shadow of the Almighty.
\q
\v 2 I will say of Yahweh, "He is my refuge and my fortress,
\q1 my God, in whom I trust."
\q
\v 3 For he will rescue you from the snare of the hunter
\q1 and from the deadly plague.
\q
\v 4 He will cover you with his wings,
\q1 and under his wings you will find refuge.
\q1 His trustworthiness is a shield and protection.
\q
\v 5 You will not be afraid of terror in the night,
\q1 or of the arrow that flies by day,
\q
\v 6 or of the plague that roams around in the darkness,
\q1 or of the disease that comes at noontime.
\q
\v 7 A thousand may fall at your side
\q1 and ten thousand at your right hand,
\q1 but it will not reach you.
\q
\v 8 You will only observe
\q1 and see the punishment of the wicked.
\q
\v 9 For Yahweh is my refuge!
\q1 Make the Most High your refuge also.
\q
\v 10 No evil will overtake you;
\q1 no affliction will come near your home.
\q
\v 11 For he will direct his angels to protect you,
\q1 to guard you in all your ways.
\q
\v 12 They will lift you up with their hand
\q1 so that you will not hit your foot on a stone.
\q
\v 13 You will crush lions and adders under your feet;
\q1 you will trample on young lions and serpents.
\q
\v 14 Because he is devoted to me, I will rescue him.
\q1 I will protect him because he is loyal to me.
\q
\v 15 When he calls to me, I will answer him.
\q1 I will be with him in trouble;
\q1 I will give him victory and will honor him.
\q
\v 16 I will satisfy him with long life
\q1 and show him my salvation.

\d A psalm, a song for the Sabbath day.
\q
\v 1 It is a good thing to give thanks to Yahweh
\q1 and to sing praises to your name, Most High,
\q
\v 2 to proclaim your covenant faithfulness in the morning
\q1 and your truthfulness every night,
\q
\v 3 with a harp of ten strings
\q1 and with the melody of the lyre.
\q
\v 4 For you, Yahweh, have made me glad through your deeds.
\q1 I will sing for joy because of the deeds of your hands.
\q
\v 5 How great are your deeds, Yahweh!
\q1 Your thoughts are very deep.
\q
\v 6 A brutish person does not know,
\q1 nor does a fool understand this:
\q
\v 7 When the wicked sprout like the grass,
\q1 and even when all the evildoers thrive,
\q1 still they are doomed to eternal destruction.
\q
\v 8 But you, Yahweh, will reign forever.
\q
\v 9 Indeed, look at your enemies, Yahweh!
\q1 Indeed, look at your enemies. They will perish!
\q1 All those who do evil will be scattered.
\q
\v 10 You have lifted up my horn like the horn of the wild ox;
\q1 I am anointed with fresh oil.
\q
\v 11 My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies;
\q1 my ears have heard of the doom of my evil foes.
\q
\v 12 The righteous will flourish like the palm tree;
\q1 they will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
\q
\v 13 They are planted in the house of Yahweh;
\q1 they flourish in the courts of our God.
\q
\v 14 They bear fruit even when they are old;
\q1 they stay fresh and green,
\q
\v 15 to proclaim that Yahweh is just.
\q1 He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
\c 93
\q
\v 1 Yahweh reigns; he is robed in majesty;
\q1 Yahweh has clothed and girded himself with strength.
\q1 The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved.
\q
\v 2 Your throne is established from ancient times;
\q1 you are from everlasting.
\q
\v 3 The oceans rise, Yahweh;
\q1 they have lifted up their voice;
\q1 the oceans' waves crash and roar.
\q
\v 4 Above the crashing of many waves,
\q1 the mighty breakers of the sea,
\q1 Yahweh on high is mighty.
\q
\v 5 Your solemn commands are very trustworthy;
\q1 holiness adorns your house,
\q1 Yahweh, forever.
\c 94
\m
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, God who avenges,
\q1 God who avenges, shine over us.
\q
\v 2 Rise up, judge of the earth,
\q1 give to the proud what they deserve.
\q
\v 3 How long will the wicked, Yahweh,
\q1 how long will the wicked rejoice?
\q
\v 4 They pour out their arrogant words;
\q1 all those who do evil boast.
\q
\v 5 They crush your people, Yahweh;
\q1 they afflict the nation that belongs to you.
\q
\v 6 They kill the widow and foreigner who lives in their country,
\q1 and they murder the fatherless.
\q
\v 7 They say, "Yahweh will not see,
\q1 the God of Jacob does not take notice of it."
\q
\v 8 Understand, you stupid people!
\q1 You fools, when will you ever learn?
\q
\v 9 He who made the ear, does he not hear?
\q1 He who formed the eye, does he not see?
\q
\v 10 He who disciplines the nations, does he not correct?
\q1 He is the one who gives knowledge to man.
\q
\v 11 Yahweh knows the thoughts of men,
\q1 that they are vapor.
\q
\v 12 Blessed is the one whom you instruct, Yahweh,
\q1 the one whom you teach from your law.
\q
\v 13 You give him rest in times of trouble
\q1 until a pit is dug for the wicked.
\q
\v 14 For Yahweh will not forsake his people
\q1 or abandon his inheritance.
\q
\v 15 For judgment will again be righteous;
\q1 and all the upright in heart will follow it.
\q
\v 16 Who will rise up to defend me against the evildoers?
\q1 Who will stand up for me against the wicked?
\q
\v 17 Unless Yahweh had been my help,
\q1 I would soon be lying down in the place of silence.
\q
\v 18 When I said, "My foot is slipping,"
\q1 Your covenant faithfulness, Yahweh, held me up.
\q
\v 19 When cares within me are many, your consolations make me happy.
\q
\v 20 Can a throne of destruction be allied with you,
\q1 one who creates injustice by statute?
\q
\v 21 They conspire together to take the life of the righteous
\q1 and they condemn the innocent to death.
\q
\v 22 But Yahweh has been my high tower,
\q1 and my God has been the rock of my refuge.
\q
\v 23 He will bring on them their own iniquity
\q1 and will cut them off in their own wickedness.
\q1 Yahweh our God will cut them off.

\q1 let us sing joyfully to the rock of our salvation.
\q
\v 2 Let us enter his presence with thanksgiving;
\q1 let us sing to him with psalms of praise.
\q
\v 3 For Yahweh is a great God
\q1 and a great King superior to all gods.
\q
\v 4 In his hand are the depths of the earth;
\q1 the heights of the mountains are his.
\q
\v 5 The sea is his, for he made it,
\q1 and his hands formed the dry land.
\q
\v 6 Oh come, let us worship and bow down;
\q1 let us kneel before Yahweh, our Creator:
\q
\v 7 For he is our God,
\q1 and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand.
\q1 Today—oh, that you would hear his voice!
\q
\v 8 "Do not harden your heart, as at Meribah,
\q1 or as on the day of Massah in the wilderness,
\q
\v 9 where your forefathers tested me
\q1 and tried me, though they had seen my deeds.
\q
\v 10 For forty years I was angry with that generation
\q1 and said, 'This is a people whose hearts wander astray;
\q1 they have not known my ways.'
\q
\v 11 Therefore I vowed in my anger
\q1 that they would never enter into my resting place."

\v 3 Declare his glory among the nations,
\q1 his marvelous deeds among all the nations.
\q
\v 4 For Yahweh is great and is to be praised greatly.
\q1 He is to be feared above all other gods.
\q
\v 5 For all the gods of the nations are idols,
\q1 but it is Yahweh who made the heavens.
\q
\v 6 Splendor and majesty are in his presence.
\q1 Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.

\v 10 Say among the nations, "Yahweh reigns."
\q1 The world also is established; it cannot be shaken.
\q1 He judges the peoples fairly.

\q1 let the sea roar and that which fills it shout with joy.
\q
\v 12 Let the fields rejoice and all that is in them.
\q1 Then let all the trees in the forest shout for joy

\q
\v 5 The mountains melt like wax before Yahweh,

\q1 and the towns of Judah rejoiced
\q1 because of your righteous decrees, Yahweh.

\q
\v 2 Do not hide your face from me in my time of trouble.
\q1 Listen to me.
\q1 When I call out to you, answer me quickly.
\q
\v 3 For my days pass away like smoke,
\q1 and my bones burn like fire.
\q
\v 4 My heart is crushed, and I am like grass that has withered.
\q1 I forget to eat any food.
\q
\v 5 With my continual groaning,
\q1 I have become very thin.
\q
\v 6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness;
\q1 I have become like an owl in the ruins.
\q
\v 7 I lie awake like a solitary bird,
\q1 alone on the housetop.
\q
\v 8 My enemies taunt me all day long;
\q1 those who mock me use my name in curses.
\q
\v 9 I eat ashes like bread
\q1 and mix my drink with tears.
\q
\v 10 Because of your raging anger,
\q1 you have lifted me up to throw me down.
\q
\v 11 My days are like a shadow that fades,
\q1 and I have withered like grass.
\q
\v 12 But you, Yahweh, live forever,
\q1 and your fame is for all generations.
\q
\v 13 You will rise up and have mercy on Zion.
\q1 Now is the time to have mercy upon her;
\q1 the appointed time has come.

\q1 and feel compassion for the dust of her ruins.
\q
\v 15 The nations will respect your name, Yahweh,
\q1 and all the kings of the earth will honor your glory.
\q
\v 16 Yahweh will rebuild Zion
\q1 and will appear in his glory.
\q
\v 17 At that time, he will respond to the prayer of the destitute;
\q1 he will not reject their prayer.
\q
\v 18 This will be written for future generations,
\q1 and a people not yet born will praise Yahweh.
\q
\v 19 For he has looked down from the holy heights;
\q1 from heaven Yahweh has viewed the earth,

\q1 to release those who were condemned to death.
\q
\v 21 Then men will proclaim the name of Yahweh in Zion
\q1 and his praise in Jerusalem
\q
\v 22 when the peoples and kingdoms gather together
\q1 to serve Yahweh.
\q
\v 23 He has taken away my strength in the middle of life.

\q
\v 2 I give praise to Yahweh with all my life,

\v 4 He redeems your life from destruction;
\q1 he crowns you with covenant faithfulness and acts of tender mercy.
\q
\v 5 He satisfies your life with good things
\q1 so that your youth is renewed like the eagle.
\q
\v 6 Yahweh does what is fair
\q1 and does acts of justice for all who are oppressed.
\q
\v 7 He made known his ways to Moses,
\q1 his deeds to the descendants of Israel.
\q
\v 8 Yahweh is merciful and gracious;
\q1 he is patient; he has great covenant loyalty.
\q
\v 9 He will not always discipline;
\q1 he is not always angry.
\q
\v 10 He does not deal with us as our sins deserve
\q1 or repay us for what our sins demand.
\q
\v 11 For as the skies are high above the earth,
\q1 so great is his covenant faithfulness toward those who honor him.
\q
\v 12 As far as the east is from the west,
\q1 this is how far he has removed the guilt of our sins from us.
\q
\v 13 As a father has compassion on his children,
\q1 so Yahweh has compassion on those who honor him.
\q
\v 14 For he knows how we are formed;
\q1 he knows that we are dust.
\q
\v 15 As for man, his days are like grass;
\q1 he flourishes like a flower in a field.
\q
\v 16 The wind blows over it, and it disappears,
\q1 and no one can even tell where it once grew.
\q
\v 17 But the covenant faithfulness of Yahweh is from everlasting to everlasting on those who honor him.

\q
\v 1 I give praise to Yahweh with all my life,
\q1 Yahweh my God, you are very magnificent;
\q1 you are clothed with splendor and majesty.
\q
\v 2 You cover yourself with light as with a garment;
\q1 you spread out the heavens like a tent curtain.
\q
\v 3 You lay the beams of your chambers on the clouds;
\q1 you make the clouds your chariot;
\q1 you walk on the wings of the wind.
\q
\v 4 He makes the winds his messengers,
\q1 flames of fire his servants.
\q
\v 5 He laid the foundations of the earth,
\q1 and it will never be moved.
\q
\v 6 You covered the earth with water like a garment;
\q1 the water covered the mountains.
\q
\v 7 Your rebuke made the waters recede;
\q1 at the sound of your thunderous voice they fled.
\q
\v 8 The mountains rose, and the valleys spread out
\q1 into the places that you had appointed for them.
\q
\v 9 You have set a boundary for them that they will not cross;
\q1 they will not cover the earth again.
\q
\v 10 He made springs flow into the valleys;
\q1 the streams flow between the mountains.
\q
\v 11 They supply water for all the animals of the field;
\q1 the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
\q
\v 12 By the riverbanks the birds build their nests;
\q1 they sing among the branches.
\q
\v 13 He waters the mountains from his water chambers in the sky.
\q1 The earth is filled with the fruit of his labor.
\q
\v 14 He makes the grass grow for the cattle
\q1 and plants for man to cultivate
\q1 so that man may produce food from the earth.
\q
\v 15 He makes wine to make man happy,
\q1 oil to make his face shine,
\q1 and food to sustain his life.
\q
\v 16 The trees of Yahweh get plenty of rain;
\q1 the cedars of Lebanon which he planted.
\q
\v 17 There the birds make their nests.
\q1 The stork makes the cypress tree her home.
\q
\v 18 The wild goats live on the high mountains;
\q1 the mountain heights are a refuge for the hyraxes.
\q
\v 19 He appointed the moon to mark the seasons;
\q1 the sun knows its time for setting.
\q
\v 20 You make the darkness of the night
\q1 when all the beasts of the forest come out.
\q
\v 21 The young lions roar for their prey
\q1 and seek their food from God.
\q
\v 22 When the sun rises, they retreat
\q1 and sleep in their dens.
\q
\v 23 Meanwhile, people go out to their work
\q1 and labor away until the evening.
\q
\v 24 Yahweh, how many and varied are your works!
\q1 With wisdom you made them all;
\q1 the earth overflows with your works.
\q
\v 25 Over there is the sea, deep and wide,
\q1 teeming with innumerable creatures,
\q1 both small and great.
\q
\v 26 The ships travel there,
\q1 and Leviathan is also there, which you formed to play in the sea.
\q
\v 27 All these look to you to give them
\q1 their food on time.
\q
\v 28 When you give to them, they gather;
\q1 when you open your hand, they are satisfied.
\q
\v 29 When you hide your face, they are troubled;
\q1 if you take away their breath, they die
\q1 and return to dust.
\q
\v 30 When you send out your Spirit, they are created,
\q1 and you renew the countryside.
\q
\v 31 May the glory of Yahweh last forever;
\q1 may Yahweh enjoy his creation.
\q

\q1 his miracles and the decrees from his mouth,
\q
\v 6 you descendants of Abraham his servant,
\q1 you people of Jacob, his chosen ones.
\q
\v 7 He is Yahweh, our God.
\q1 His decrees are on all the earth.
\q
\v 8 He keeps in mind his covenant forever,
\q1 the word that he commanded for a thousand generations.
\q
\v 9 He calls to mind the covenant that he made with Abraham
\q1 and his oath to Isaac.
\q
\v 10 This is what he confirmed to Jacob as a statute
\q1 and to Israel as an everlasting covenant.
\q
\v 11 He said, "I will give you the land of Canaan
\q1 as your share of your inheritance."
\q
\v 12 He said this when they were only few in number,
\q1 so very few, and were strangers in the land.
\q
\v 13 They went from nation to nation
\q1 and from one kingdom to another.
\q
\v 14 He did not allow anyone to oppress them;
\q1 he rebuked kings for their sakes.
\q
\v 15 He said, "Do not touch my anointed ones,
\q1 and do not harm my prophets."
\q
\v 16 He called for a famine on the land;
\q1 he cut off the whole supply of bread.
\q
\v 17 He sent a man ahead of them;
\q1 Joseph was sold as a servant.
\q
\v 18 His feet were bound by shackles;
\q1 on his neck was put an iron collar,
\q
\v 19 until what he had said came to pass.
\q1 The word of Yahweh tested him.
\q
\v 20 The king sent servants to release him;
\q1 the ruler of the people set him free.
\q
\v 21 He put him in charge of his house
\q1 as ruler of all his possessions
\q
\v 22 to instruct his princes as he wished
\q1 and to teach his elders wisdom.
\q
\v 23 Then Israel came into Egypt,
\q1 and Jacob lived for a time in the land of Ham.
\q
\v 24 Yahweh made his people fruitful,
\q1 and made them stronger than their enemies.
\q
\v 25 He caused their enemies to hate his people,
\q1 to mistreat his servants.
\q
\v 26 He sent Moses, his servant,
\q1 and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
\q
\v 27 They performed his signs among the Egyptians,
\q1 his wonders in the land of Ham.
\q
\v 28 He sent darkness and made that land dark,
\q1 but its people did not obey his commands.
\q
\v 29 He turned their water into blood
\q1 and killed their fish.
\q
\v 30 Their land swarmed with frogs,
\q1 even in the rooms of their rulers.
\q
\v 31 He spoke, and swarms of flies and gnats came
\q1 throughout their country.
\q
\v 32 He turned their rain into hail,
\q1 with fire flaming on their land.
\q
\v 33 He destroyed their vines and fig trees;
\q1 he broke the trees of their country.
\q
\v 34 He spoke, and the locusts came,
\q1 so many locusts.
\q
\v 35 The locusts ate up all of the vegetation in their land;
\q1 They ate up all the crops of the ground.
\q
\v 36 He killed every firstborn in their land,
\q1 the firstfruits of all their strength.
\q
\v 37 He brought the Israelites out with silver and gold;
\q1 none of his tribes stumbled on the way.
\q
\v 38 Egypt was glad when they went away,
\q1 for the Egyptians were afraid of them.
\q
\v 39 He spread a cloud for a covering
\q1 and made a fire to light up the night.
\q
\v 40 The Israelites asked for food, and he brought quail
\q1 and satisfied them with bread from heaven.
\q
\v 41 He split the rock, and waters gushed from it;
\q1 they flowed in the wilderness like a river.
\q
\v 42 For he called to mind his holy promise
\q1 that he made to Abraham his servant.
\q
\v 43 He led his people out with joy,
\q1 his chosen with shouts of triumph.
\q
\v 44 He gave them the lands of the nations;
\q1 they took possession of the wealth of the peoples
\q
\v 45 so that they might keep his statutes
\q1 and obey his laws.
\q1 Praise Yahweh.
\c 106
\m
\q
\v 1 Praise Yahweh.
\q1 Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,
\q1 for his covenant faithfulness endures forever.
\q
\v 2 Who can recount the mighty acts of Yahweh
\q1 or proclaim in full all his praiseworthy deeds?
\q
\v 3 Blessed are those who do what is right,
\q1 and whose deeds are always just.
\q
\v 4 Call me to mind, Yahweh, when you show favor to your people;
\q1 help me when you save them.
\q
\v 5 Then I will see the prosperity of your chosen,
\q1 rejoice in the gladness of your nation,
\q1 and glory with your inheritance.
\q
\v 6 We have sinned like our ancestors;
\q1 we have done wrong, and we have done evil.
\q
\v 7 Our fathers did not appreciate your marvelous deeds in Egypt;
\q1 they ignored your many acts of covenant faithfulness;
\q1 they were rebellious at the sea, the Sea of Reeds.
\q
\v 8 Nevertheless, he saved them for his name's sake
\q1 so that he might reveal his power.
\q
\v 9 He rebuked the Sea of Reeds, and it dried up.
\q1 Then he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.
\q
\v 10 He saved them from the hand of those who hated them,
\q1 and he rescued them from the hand of the enemy.
\q
\v 11 But the waters covered their adversaries;
\q1 not one of them survived.
\q
\v 12 Then they believed his words,
\q1 and they sang his praise.
\q
\v 13 But they quickly forgot what he had done;
\q1 they did not wait for his instructions.
\q
\v 14 They had insatiable cravings in the wilderness,
\q1 and they challenged God in the desert.
\q
\v 15 So he gave them what they requested,
\q2 but he sent a horrible disease upon them.
\q
\v 16 In the camp they became jealous of Moses
\q1 and Aaron, the holy priest of Yahweh.
\q
\v 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan
\q1 and covered the followers of Abiram.
\q
\v 18 Fire broke out among them;
\q1 the fire consumed the wicked.
\q
\v 19 They made a calf at Horeb
\q1 and worshiped a cast metal figure.
\q
\v 20 They traded the glory of God
\q1 for the image of a bull that eats grass.
\q
\v 21 They forgot God their Savior,
\q1 who had done great deeds in Egypt.
\q
\v 22 He had done wonderful things in the land of Ham
\q1 and mighty acts at the Sea of Reeds.
\q
\v 23 So he said he would destroy them—
\q1 had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him,
\q1 to turn away his anger from destroying them.
\q
\v 24 Then they despised the fruitful land;
\q1 they did not believe his promise,
\q
\v 25 but grumbled in their tents,
\q1 and did not obey Yahweh.
\q
\v 26 Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them
\q1 that he would let them die in the desert,
\q
\v 27 scatter their descendants among the nations,
\q1 and scatter them in foreign lands.
\q
\v 28 They worshiped the Baal of Peor
\q1 and ate the sacrifices offered to the dead.
\q
\v 29 They provoked him to anger with their actions,
\q1 and a plague broke out among them.
\q
\v 30 Then Phinehas rose to intervene,
\q1 and the plague subsided.
\q
\v 31 It was counted to him as a righteous deed
\q1 to all generations forever.
\q
\v 32 They also angered Yahweh at the waters of Meribah,
\q1 and Moses suffered because of them.
\q
\v 33 They made Moses bitter,
\q1 and he spoke rashly.
\q
\v 34 They did not destroy the nations
\q1 as Yahweh had commanded them,
\q
\v 35 but they mingled with the nations
\q1 and learned their ways
\q
\v 36 and worshiped their idols,
\q1 which became a snare to them.
\q
\v 37 They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.
\q
\v 38 They shed innocent blood,
\q1 the blood of their sons and of their daughters,
\q1 whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan,
\q1 desecrating the land with blood.
\q
\v 39 They were defiled by their deeds;
\q1 in their actions they were like prostitutes.
\q
\v 40 So Yahweh was angry with his people,
\q1 and he despised his own people.
\q
\v 41 He gave them into the hand of the nations,
\q1 and those who hated them ruled over them.
\q
\v 42 Their enemies oppressed them,
\q1 and they were brought into subjection to their authority.
\q
\v 43 Many times he came to help them,
\q1 but they kept rebelling
\q1 and were brought low by their own sin.
\q
\v 44 Nevertheless, he paid attention to their distress
\q1 when he heard their cry for help.
\q
\v 45 He called to mind his covenant with them
\q1 and relented because of his steadfast love.
\q
\v 46 He caused all their conquerers
\q1 to have pity on them.
\q
\v 47 Save us, Yahweh, our God.
\q1 Gather us from among the nations
\q1 so that we may give thanks to your holy name
\q1 and glory in your praises.
\q
\v 48 May Yahweh, the God of Israel, be praised
\q1 from everlasting to everlasting.
\q1 All the people said, "Amen."
\q1 Praise Yahweh.
\ms Book Five
\c 107
\q
\v 1 Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,
\q1 and his covenant faithfulness endures forever.
\q
\v 2 Let the redeemed of Yahweh speak out,
\q1 those he has rescued from the hand of the enemy.
\q
\v 3 He has gathered them out of foreign lands,
\q1 from the east and from the west,
\q1 from the north and from the south.
\q
\v 4 They wandered in the wilderness on a desert road
\q1 and found no city in which to live.
\q
\v 5 Because they were hungry and thirsty,
\q1 they fainted from exhaustion.
\q
\v 6 Then they called out to Yahweh in their trouble,
\q1 and he rescued them out of their distress.
\q
\v 7 He led them by a direct path
\q1 so that they would go to a city to live in.
\q
\v 8 Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his covenant faithfulness
\q1 and for the amazing things he has done for humanity!
\q
\v 9 For he satisfies the longings of those who are thirsty,
\q1 and the desires of those who are hungry he fills up with good things.
\q
\v 10 Some sat in darkness and in gloom,
\q1 prisoners in affliction and chains.
\q
\v 11 This was because they had rebelled against God's word
\q1 and rejected the instruction of the Most High.
\q
\v 12 He humbled their hearts through hardship;
\q1 they stumbled and there was no one to help them up.
\q
\v 13 Then they called out to Yahweh in their trouble,
\q1 and he brought them out of their distress.
\q
\v 14 He brought them out of darkness and gloom
\q1 and broke their bonds.
\q
\v 15 Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his covenant faithfulness
\q1 and for the amazing things he has done for humanity!
\q
\v 16 For he has broken the gates of bronze
\q1 and cut through the bars of iron.
\q
\v 17 They were foolish in their rebellious ways
\q1 and afflicted because of their sins.
\q
\v 18 They lost their desire to eat any food,
\q1 and they came close to the gates of death.
\q
\v 19 Then they called out to Yahweh in their trouble,
\q1 and he brought them out of their distress.
\q
\v 20 He sent his word and healed them,
\q1 and he rescued them from their destruction.
\q
\v 21 Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his covenant faithfulness
\q1 and for the amazing things he has done for humanity!
\q
\v 22 Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving
\q1 and proclaim his deeds in singing.
\q
\v 23 Some travel on the sea in ships
\q1 and do business overseas.
\q
\v 24 These saw the deeds of Yahweh
\q1 and his wonders on the seas.
\q
\v 25 For he commanded and aroused the windstorm
\q1 that stirs up the seas.
\q
\v 26 They reached up to the sky; they went down to the depths.
\q1 Their lives melted away in distress.
\q
\v 27 They swayed and staggered like drunkards
\q1 and were at their wits' end.
\q
\v 28 Then they called out to Yahweh in their trouble,
\q1 and he brought them out of their distress.
\q
\v 29 He calmed the storm,
\q1 and the waves were stilled.
\q
\v 30 Then they rejoiced because the sea was calm,
\q1 and he brought them to their desired harbor.
\q
\v 31 Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his covenant faithfulness
\q1 and for the amazing things he has done for humanity!
\q
\v 32 Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people
\q1 and praise him in the council of the elders.
\q
\v 33 He turns rivers into a wilderness,
\q1 springs of water into dry land,
\q
\v 34 and a fruitful land into a barren place
\q1 because of the wickedness of its people.
\q
\v 35 He turns the wilderness into a pool of water
\q1 and dry land into springs of water.
\q
\v 36 He settles the hungry there,
\q1 and they build a city to live in.
\q
\v 37 They build a city to plant fields in, to plant vineyards,
\q1 and to bring in an abundant harvest.
\q
\v 38 He blesses them so they are very numerous.
\q1 He does not let their cattle decrease in number.
\q
\v 39 They were diminished and brought low
\q1 by painful distress and suffering.
\q
\v 40 He pours contempt on the leaders
\q1 and causes them to wander in the wilderness, where there are no roads.
\q
\v 41 But he protects the needy from affliction
\q1 and cares for his families like a flock.
\q
\v 42 The upright will see this and rejoice,
\q1 and all wickedness shuts its mouth.
\q
\v 43 Whoever is wise should take note of these things
\q1 and meditate on Yahweh's acts of covenant faithfulness.

\v 2 Wake up, lute and harp;
\q1 I will wake up the dawn.
\q
\v 3 I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the peoples;

\v 4 For your covenant faithfulness is great above the heavens;
\q1 and your trustworthiness reaches to the skies.

\v 5 Be exalted, God, above the heavens,
\q1 and may your glory be exalted over all the earth.
\q
\v 6 So that those you love may be rescued,
\q1 rescue us with your right hand and answer me.

\v 7 God has spoken in his holiness; "I will rejoice;
\q1 I will divide Shechem and apportion out the Valley of Succoth.
\q
\v 8 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine;
\q1 Ephraim also is my helmet;
\q1 Judah is my scepter.

\v 10 Who will bring me into the strong city?
\q1 Who will lead me to Edom?"
\q
\v 11 God, have you not rejected us?
\q1 You do not go into battle with our army.

\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David.

\v 2 For the wicked and deceitful attack me;
\q1 they speak lies against me.
\q
\v 3 They surround me and say hateful things,
\q1 and they attack me without cause.
\q
\v 4 In return for my love they accuse me,
\q1 but I pray for them.
\q
\v 5 They repay me evil for good,

\q
\v 6 Appoint a wicked man over such an enemy as these people;
\q1 appoint an accuser to stand at his right hand.
\q
\v 7 When he is judged, may he be found guilty;
\q1 may his prayer be considered sinful.
\q
\v 8 May his days be few;
\q1 may another take his office.
\q
\v 9 May his children be fatherless,
\q1 and may his wife be a widow.
\q
\v 10 May his children wander about and beg,
\q1 asking for handouts as they leave their ruined home.
\q
\v 11 May the creditor take all he owns;
\q1 may strangers plunder what he earns.
\q
\v 12 May no one extend any kindness to him;
\q1 may no one have pity on his fatherless children.
\q
\v 13 May his children be cut off;
\q1 may their name be blotted out in the next generation.
\q
\v 14 May his ancestors' sins be mentioned to Yahweh;
\q1 and may the sin of his mother not be forgotten.
\q
\v 15 May their guilt always be before Yahweh;
\q1 may Yahweh cut off their memory from the earth.
\q
\v 16 May Yahweh do this because this man never bothered to show any covenant faithfulness,
\q1 but instead harassed the oppressed, the needy,
\q1 and the disheartened to death.
\q
\v 17 He loved cursing; may it come back upon him.
\q1 He hated blessing; may no blessing come to him.
\q
\v 18 He clothed himself with cursing as his garment,
\q1 and his curse came into his inner being like water,
\q1 like oil into his bones.
\q
\v 19 May his curses be to him like the clothes he wears to cover himself,
\q1 like the belt he always wears.
\q
\v 20 May this be the reward of my accusers from Yahweh,
\q1 of those who say evil things about me.
\q
\v 21 Yahweh my Lord, deal kindly with me for your name's sake.
\q1 Because your covenant faithfulness is good, save me.
\q
\v 22 For I am oppressed and needy,
\q1 and my heart is wounded within me.
\q
\v 23 I am fading away like the shadow of the evening;
\q1 I am shaken off like a locust.
\q
\v 24 My knees are weak from fasting;
\q1 I am turning to skin and bones.
\q
\v 25 I am disdained by my accusers;
\q1 when they see me, they shake their heads.

\v 26 Help me, Yahweh my God;
\q1 save me by your covenant faithfulness.

\v 27 May they know that this is your doing,
\q1 that you, Yahweh, have done this.

\q
\v 1 I love Yahweh because he hears
\q1 my voice and my pleas for mercy.
\q
\v 2 Because he listened to me,
\q1 I will call on him as long as I live.
\q
\v 3 The cords of death surrounded me,
\q1 and the snares of Sheol confronted me;
\q1 I felt anguish and sorrow.
\q
\v 4 Then I called on the name of Yahweh:
\q1 "Please Yahweh, rescue my life."
\q
\v 5 Yahweh is merciful and fair;
\q1 our God is compassionate.
\q
\v 6 Yahweh protects the naive;
\q1 I was brought low, and he saved me.
\q
\v 7 My soul can return to its resting place,
\q1 for Yahweh has been good to me.
\q
\v 8 For you rescued my life from death,
\q1 my eyes from tears,
\q1 and my feet from stumbling.
\q
\v 9 I will serve Yahweh
\q1 in the land of the living.
\q
\v 10 I believed in him, even when I said,
\q1 "I am greatly afflicted."
\q
\v 11 In my confusion I said,
\q1 "All men are liars."
\q
\v 12 How can I repay Yahweh
\q1 for all his kindnesses to me?
\q
\v 13 I will raise the cup of salvation,
\q1 and call on the name of Yahweh.
\q
\v 14 I will fulfill my vows to Yahweh
\q1 in the presence of all his people.
\q
\v 15 Precious in the sight of Yahweh
\q1 is the death of his saints.
\q
\v 16 Yahweh, indeed, I am your servant;
\q1 I am your servant, the son of your servant woman;
\q1 you have taken away my bonds.
\q
\v 17 I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving
\q1 and will call on the name of Yahweh.
\q
\v 18 I will fulfill my vows to Yahweh
\q1 in the presence of all his people,

\q

\q1 "His covenant faithfulness endures forever."
\q
\v 4 Let the loyal followers of Yahweh say,
\q1 "His covenant faithfulness endures for ever."
\q
\v 5 In my distress I called out to Yahweh;
\q1 Yahweh answered me and set me free.
\q
\v 6 Yahweh is with me; I will not be afraid;
\q1 what can man do to me?
\q
\v 7 Yahweh is on my side as my helper;
\q1 I will look in triumph on those who hate me.
\q
\v 8 It is better to take shelter in Yahweh
\q1 than to put confidence in man.
\q
\v 9 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh
\q1 than to put one's trust in a princes.
\q
\v 10 All the nations surrounded me;
\q1 in Yahweh's name I cut them off.
\q
\v 11 They surrounded me; yes, they surrounded me;
\q1 in Yahweh's name I cut them off.
\q
\v 12 They surrounded me like bees;
\q1 they disappeared as quickly as fire among thorns;
\q1 in Yahweh's name I cut them off.
\q
\v 13 They attacked me to knock me down,
\q1 but Yahweh helped me.
\q
\v 14 Yahweh is my strength and joy,
\q1 and he is the one who rescues me.
\q
\v 15 The joyful shout of victory is heard in the tents of the righteous;
\q1 the right hand of Yahweh conquers.
\q
\v 16 The right hand of Yahweh is exalted;
\q1 the right hand of Yahweh conquers.

\v 1 I was glad when they said to me,
\q1 "Let us go to the house of Yahweh."
\q
\v 2 Jerusalem, our feet are standing
\q1 within your gates!
\q
\v 3 Jerusalem, built
\q1 as a city carefully planned!
\q
\v 4 The tribes go up to Jerusalem—the tribes of Yahweh—
\q1 as a testimony for Israel,
\q1 to give thanks to the name of Yahweh.
\q
\v 5 There thrones of judgment were set,
\q1 thrones of the house of David.
\q
\v 6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem!
\q1 "May those who love you have peace.
\q
\v 7 May there be peace within the walls that defend you,
\q1 and may they have peace within your fortresses."
\q
\v 8 For the sake of my brothers and my friends
\q1 I will say, "May there be peace within you."
\q
\v 9 For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God,
\q1 I will seek good for you.
\c 123
\m
\d A song of ascents.
\q
\v 1 To you I lift up my eyes,
\q1 you who are enthroned in the heavens.
\q
\v 2 See, as the eyes of servants look to their master's hand,
\q1 as the eyes of a maid look to her mistress's hand,
\q1 so our eyes look to Yahweh our God
\q1 until he has mercy on us.
\q
\v 3 Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us,
\q1 for we are filled with humiliation.
\q
\v 4 We are more than full
\q1 of the scoffing of the insolent
\q1 and with the contempt of the proud.
\c 124
\m
\d A song of ascents; of David.
\q
\v 1 "If Yahweh had not been on our side,"
\q1 let Israel say now,
\q
\v 2 "if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side
\q1 when men rose up against us,
\q
\v 3 then they would have swallowed us up alive
\q1 when their anger raged against us.
\q
\v 4 The water would have swept us away;
\q1 the torrent would have overwhelmed us.
\q
\v 5 Then the raging waters would have drowned us."
\q
\v 6 Blessed be Yahweh,
\q1 who has not allowed us to be torn by their teeth.
\q
\v 7 We have escaped like a bird out of the snare of the fowlers;
\q1 the snare has been broken, and we have escaped.
\q
\v 8 Our help is in Yahweh,
\q1 who made heaven and earth.
\c 125
\m
\d A song of ascents.
\q
\v 1 Those who trust in Yahweh
\q1 are like Mount Zion, unshakable, forever enduring.
\q
\v 2 As the mountains surround Jerusalem,
\q1 so Yahweh surrounds his people
\q1 now and forever.
\q
\v 3 The scepter of wickedness must not rule in the land of the righteous.
\q1 Otherwise the righteous might do what is wrong.
\q
\v 4 Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good
\q1 and to those who are upright in their hearts.
\q
\v 5 But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways,
\q1 Yahweh will lead them away with the evildoers.
\q1 May peace be on Israel.
\c 126
\m
\d A song of ascents.
\q
\v 1 When Yahweh restored the fortunes of Zion,
\q1 we were like those who dream.
\q
\v 2 Then our mouths were filled with laughter
\q1 and our tongues with singing.
\q1 Then they said among the nations,
\q1 "Yahweh has done great things for them."
\q
\v 3 Yahweh did great things for us;
\q1 how glad we were!
\q
\v 4 Restore our fortunes, Yahweh,
\q1 like the streams in the Negev.
\q
\v 5 Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy.
\q
\v 6 He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing,
\q1 will return again with shouts of joy, bringing his bundles of grain with him.
\c 127
\m
\d A song of ascents, of Solomon.
\q
\v 1 Unless Yahweh builds the house,
\q1 they work uselessly, those who build it.
\q1 Unless Yahweh guards the city,
\q1 the watchman stands guard uselessly.
\q
\v 2 It is useless for you to rise up early,
\q1 to come home late,
\q1 or to eat the bread of hard work,
\q1 for Yahweh provides for his beloved as they sleep.
\q
\v 3 See, children are a heritage from Yahweh,
\q1 and the fruit of the womb is a reward from him.
\q
\v 4 Like arrows in the hand of a warrior,
\q1 so are the children of one's youth.
\q
\v 5 How blessed is the man that has his quiver full of them.
\q1 He will not be put to shame
\q1 when he confronts his enemies in the gate.
\c 128
\m
\d A song of ascents.
\q
\v 1 Blessed is everyone who honors Yahweh,
\q1 who walks in his ways.
\q
\v 2 What your hands provide, you will enjoy;
\q1 you will be blessed and prosper.
\q
\v 3 Your wife will be like a fruitful vine
\q1 in your house;
\q1 your children will be like olive plants
\q1 as they sit around your table.
\q
\v 4 Yes, indeed, the man will be blessed
\q1 who honors Yahweh.
\q
\v 5 May Yahweh bless you from Zion;
\q1 may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
\q
\v 6 May you live to see your children's children.
\q1 May peace be on Israel.
\c 129
\m
\d A song of ascents.
\q
\v 1 "Often since my youth they have attacked me,"
\q1 let Israel say.
\q
\v 2 "Often since my youth they have attacked me,
\q1 yet they have not defeated me.
\q
\v 3 The plowers plowed on my back;
\q1 they made their furrows long.
\q
\v 4 Yahweh is righteous;
\q1 he has cut the ropes of the wicked."
\q
\v 5 May they all be put to shame and turned back,
\q1 those who hate Zion.
\q
\v 6 May they be like the grass on the housetops
\q1 that withers before it grows up,
\q
\v 7 that cannot fill the reaper's hand
\q1 or the chest of the one who binds bundles of grain together.
\q
\v 8 May those who pass by not say,
\q1 "May the blessing of Yahweh be on you;
\q1 we bless you in the name of Yahweh."
\c 130
\m
\d A song of ascents.
\q
\v 1 Out of the depths I cry to you, Yahweh.
\q
\v 2 Lord, hear my voice;
\q1 let your ears be attentive
\q1 to my pleas for mercy.
\q
\v 3 If you, Yahweh, would mark iniquities,
\q1 Lord, who could stand?
\q
\v 4 But there is forgiveness with you,
\q1 that you may be revered.
\q
\v 5 I wait for Yahweh, my soul waits,
\q1 and in his word I hope.
\q
\v 6 My soul waits for the Lord
\q1 more than watchmen wait for the morning.
\q
\v 7 Israel, hope in Yahweh.
\q1 Yahweh is merciful,
\q1 and he is very willing to forgive.
\q
\v 8 It is he who will redeem Israel
\q1 from all his sins.
\c 131
\m
\d A song of ascents; of David.
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, my heart is not proud or my eyes haughty.
\q1 I do not have great hopes for myself
\q1 or concern myself with things that are beyond me.
\q
\v 2 Indeed I have stilled and quieted my soul;
\q1 like a weaned child with his mother,
\q1 my soul within me is like a weaned child.
\q
\v 3 Israel, hope in Yahweh
\q1 now and forever.
\c 132
\m
\d A song of ascents.
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, for David's sake call to mind
\q1 all his afflictions.
\q
\v 2 Call to mind how he swore to Yahweh,
\q1 how he vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob.
\q
\v 3 He said, "I will not enter my house
\q1 or get into my bed,
\q
\v 4 I will not give sleep to my eyes
\q1 or rest to my eyelids
\q
\v 5 until I find a place for Yahweh,
\q1 a tabernacle for the Mighty One of Jacob."
\q
\v 6 See, we heard about it in Ephrathah;
\q1 we found it in the fields of Jaar.
\q
\v 7 We will go into God's tabernacle;
\q1 we will worship at his footstool.
\q
\v 8 Arise, Yahweh, to your resting place,
\q1 you and the ark of your strength!
\q
\v 9 May your priests be clothed with integrity;
\q1 may your faithful ones shout for joy.
\q
\v 10 For your servant David's sake,
\q1 do not turn away from your anointed king.
\q
\v 11 Yahweh swore a sure oath to David,
\q1 a sure oath that he will not revoke:
\q1 "I will place one of your descendants on your throne.
\q
\v 12 If your sons keep my covenant
\q1 and the laws that I will teach them,
\q1 their children also will sit on your throne forevermore."
\q
\v 13 Certainly Yahweh has chosen Zion,
\q1 he has desired her for his seat.
\q
\v 14 "This is my resting place forever.
\q1 I will live here, for I desire her.
\q
\v 15 I will abundantly bless her with provisions.
\q1 I will satisfy her poor with bread.
\q
\v 16 I will clothe her priests with salvation,
\q1 her faithful ones will shout aloud for joy.
\q
\v 17 There I will make a horn to sprout for David
\q1 and set up a lamp for my anointed one.
\q
\v 18 I will clothe his enemies with shame,
\q1 but on him his crown will shine."
\c 133
\m
\d A song of ascents, of David.
\q
\v 1 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is
\q1 for brothers to live together!
\q
\v 2 It is like fine oil on the head
\q1 pouring down on the beard—
\q1 Aaron's beard,
\q1 and then it pours down on the collar of his robes.
\q
\v 3 It is like the dew of Hermon
\q1 which falls on the mountains of Zion.
\q1 For there Yahweh commanded the blessing—
\q1 life forevermore.
\c 134
\m
\d A song of ascents.
\q
\v 1 Come, bless Yahweh, all you servants of Yahweh,
\q1 you who serve during the night in Yahweh's house.
\q
\v 2 Lift up your hands to the holy place
\q1 and bless Yahweh.
\q
\v 3 May Yahweh bless you from Zion,
\q1 he who made heaven and earth.
\c 135
\m
\q
\v 1 Praise Yahweh.
\q1 Praise the name of Yahweh.
\q1 Praise him, you servants of Yahweh,
\q
\v 2 you who stand in Yahweh's house,
\q1 in the courtyards of the house of our God.
\q
\v 3 Praise Yahweh, for he is good;
\q1 sing praises to his name, for it is pleasant to do so.
\q
\v 4 For Yahweh has chosen Jacob for himself,
\q1 Israel as his possession.
\q
\v 5 I know that Yahweh is great,
\q1 that our Lord is above all gods.
\q
\v 6 Whatever Yahweh desires, he does
\q1 in heaven, on earth, in the seas and all the ocean depths.
\q
\v 7 He brings the clouds from far away,
\q1 making lightning bolts accompany the rain
\q1 and bringing the wind out of his storehouse.
\q
\v 8 He killed the firstborn of Egypt,
\q1 both of man and animals.
\q
\v 9 He sent signs and wonders into your midst, Egypt,
\q1 against Pharaoh and all his servants.
\q
\v 10 He attacked many nations
\q1 and killed mighty kings,
\q
\v 11 Sihon king of the Amorites
\q1 and Og king of Bashan
\q1 and all the kingdoms of Canaan.
\q
\v 12 He gave us their land as an inheritance,
\q1 an inheritance to Israel his people.
\q
\v 13 Your name, Yahweh, endures forever;
\q1 your renown, Yahweh, endures throughout all generations.
\q
\v 14 For Yahweh defends his people
\q1 and has compassion on his servants.
\q
\v 15 The nations' idols are silver and gold,
\q1 the work of men's hands.
\q
\v 16 Those idols have mouths, but they do not speak;
\q1 they have eyes, but they do not see;
\q
\v 17 they have ears, but they do not hear,
\q1 nor is there breath in their mouths.
\q
\v 18 Those who make them are like them,
\q1 as is everyone who trusts in them.
\q
\v 19 Descendants of Israel, bless Yahweh;
\q1 descendants of Aaron, bless Yahweh.
\q
\v 20 Descendants of Levi, bless Yahweh;
\q1 you who honor Yahweh, bless Yahweh.
\q
\v 21 Blessed be Yahweh in Zion,
\q1 he who lives in Jerusalem.
\q1 Praise Yahweh.

\q
\v 12 with a strong hand and a raised arm,

\q
\v 15 but overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Sea of Reeds,

\v 1 By the rivers of Babylon
\q1 we sat down and wept
\q1 when we thought about Zion.
\q
\v 2 On the poplars there
\q1 we hung our harps.
\q
\v 3 There our captors required songs from us,
\q1 and those who mocked us required us to be happy, saying,
\q1 "Sing us one of the songs of Zion."
\q
\v 4 How could we sing a song about Yahweh
\q1 in a foreign land?
\q
\v 5 If I ignore the memory of you, Jerusalem,
\q1 let my right hand forget her skill.
\q
\v 6 Let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth
\q1 if I think about you no more,
\q1 if I do not prefer Jerusalem
\q1 more than my greatest delights.
\q
\v 7 Call to mind, Yahweh, what the Edomites did
\q1 on the day Jerusalem fell.
\q1 They said, "Tear it down, tear it down
\q1 to its foundations."
\q
\v 8 Daughter of Babylon, soon to be destroyed—
\q1 may the person be blessed, whoever pays you back
\q1 for what you have done to us.
\q
\v 9 May the person be blessed, whoever takes and dashes your little ones
\q1 against a rock.

\d A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 I will give you thanks with my whole heart;
\q1 before the gods I will sing praises to you.
\q
\v 2 I will bow down toward your holy temple
\q1 and give thanks to your name for your covenant faithfulness and for your trustworthiness.
\q1 You have made your word and your name more important than anything else.
\q
\v 3 On the day that I called you, you answered me;
\q1 you made me bold and strengthened my soul.
\q
\v 4 All the kings of the earth will give you thanks, Yahweh,
\q1 for they will hear the words from your mouth.
\q
\v 5 Indeed, they will sing of the deeds of Yahweh,
\q1 for great is the glory of Yahweh.
\q
\v 6 For though Yahweh is high, yet he cares for the lowly,
\q1 but the proud he knows from far off.
\q
\v 7 Though I walk in the middle of danger, you will preserve my life;
\q1 you will reach out with your hand against the anger of my enemies,
\q1 and your right hand will save me.
\q
\v 8 Yahweh is with me to the end;
\q1 your covenant faithfulness, Yahweh, endures forever.
\q1 Do not forsake the ones whom your hands have made.

\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Yahweh, you have examined me, and you know me.
\q
\v 2 You know when I sit down and when I get up;
\q1 you understand my thoughts from far away.
\q
\v 3 You observe my path and my lying down;
\q1 you are familiar with all my ways.
\q
\v 4 For before there is a word on my tongue,
\q1 you know it completely, Yahweh.
\q
\v 5 Behind me and before me you surround me
\q1 and place your hand upon me.
\q
\v 6 Such knowledge is too much for me;
\q1 it is too high, and I cannot reach it.
\q
\v 7 Where can I go from your Spirit?
\q1 Where can I flee from your presence?
\q
\v 8 If I ascend up to the heavens, you are there;
\q1 if I make my bed in Sheol, behold, you are there.
\q
\v 9 If I fly away on the wings of the morning
\q1 and go to live in the uttermost parts across the sea,
\q
\v 10 even there your hand will lead me,
\q1 your right hand will hold on to me.
\q
\v 11 If I said, "Surely the darkness will cover me,
\q1 and the light will become night around me,"
\q
\v 12 even the darkness would not be dark to you.
\q1 The night would shine like the day,
\q1 for the darkness and the light are both alike to you.
\q
\v 13 You formed my inner parts;
\q1 you formed me in my mother's womb.
\q
\v 14 I will praise you,
\q1 for I am wonderfully made.
\q1 My soul knows this very well.
\q
\v 15 My bones were not hidden from you
\q1 when I was made in private,
\q1 when I was intricately made in the depths of the earth.
\q
\v 16 You saw me inside the womb;
\q1 all the days assigned to me were recorded
\q1 in your book even before the first one happened.
\q
\v 17 How precious are your thoughts to me, God!
\q1 How vast is their sum!
\q
\v 18 If I tried to count them, they would be more in number than the sand.
\q1 When I awake, I am still with you.
\q
\v 19 If only you would kill the wicked, God;
\q1 get away from me, you violent men.

\q1 your enemies tell lies.
\q
\v 21 Do I not hate those, Yahweh, who hate you?
\q1 Do I not despise those who rise up against you?
\q
\v 22 I hate them completely;
\q1 they have become my enemies.
\q
\v 23 Examine me, God, and know my heart;
\q1 test me and know my thoughts.

\v 5 The proud have set a trap for me;
\q1 they have spread a net;
\q1 they have set a snare for me. \qs Selah\qs*

\v 6 I said to Yahweh, "You are my God;
\q1 listen to my cries for mercy."
\q
\v 7 Yahweh, my Lord, you are powerfully able to save me;

\q1 Let him correct me; it will be like oil on my head;
\q1 may my head not refuse to accept it.
\q1 But my prayer is always against their wicked deeds.
\q
